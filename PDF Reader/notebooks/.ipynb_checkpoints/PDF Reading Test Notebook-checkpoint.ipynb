[Operator Instructions] And now I\\'d like to introduce your host for today\\'s program Mark Nogal Head of Investor\\nRelations. Please go ahead sir.\\nMark Nogal\\nHead of Investor Relations\\nThank you Jonathan. Good morning and welcome everyone to Allstate\\'s First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call.\\nAfter prepared remarks we will have a question-and-answer session.\\nYesterday following the close of the market we issued our news release and investor supplement filed our 10-Q and\\nposted today\\'s presentation along with our reinsurance update on our website at allstateinvestors.com.\\nOur management team is here to provide perspective on these results and further context on our response to the\\ncoronavirus pandemic.\\nAs noted on the first slide of the presentation our discussion will contain non-GAAP measures for which there are\\nreconciliations in the news release and investor supplement and forward-looking statements throughout Allstate\\'s\\noperations. Allstate\\'s results may differ materially from these statements so please refer to our 10-K for 2019 and other\\npublic documents for information on potential risks.\\nAnd now I\\'ll turn it over to Tom.\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nGood morning. Thank you for joining us from wherever you are sheltered in place.\\nLet\\'s jump right in with Allstate\\'s response to the coronavirus pandemic on Slide 2.\\nAllstate has been helping customers overcome catastrophes for 89 years and we\\'ve learned to act decisively quickly\\nand put customers first. As a result we\\'ve led the industry in helping customers. We created a Shelter-in-Place Payback\\nprogram of more than $600 million. Special payment plans are being used for customers experiencing financial\\nchallenges. Auto insurance coverage was expanded to cover the use of personal vehicles to deliver food medicine and\\nother goods for commercial purposes. Allstate Identity Protection is being offered for free for the rest of the year to all U.S.\\nresidents given the increased exposure to cybercrime.\\nBusiness continuity plans were executed. Virtual sales and support capabilities were expanded. And we leveraged our\\ndigital innovations such as QuickFoto Claim and Virtual Assist to better protect our customers employees and agents.\\nEmployees and Allstate agents moved to more than 95% working remotely and we altered a number of business\\npractices to support our agents and employees.\\nAt the same time Allstate is financially strong with significant capital and liquidity. In February we reduced our public\\nequity holdings by $4 billion to reduce the amount of economic capital back in the investment portfolio. But this turned out\\nto be good timing because it enabled us to reduce the impact of the market downturn in March. And as Mario will cover\\nlater we will maintain our share repurchase program given the strong capital position.\\nFor our communities the Allstate Foundation announced an additional $5 million that\\'s on top of the money we normally\\ngrant every year which is substantial to help deal with the pandemic and double demand for Allstate employees\\' need.\\nMove to Slide 3. Let\\'s touch base with Allstate\\'s strategy. As you know our strategy has 2 components: increase personal\\nProperty-Liability market share and expand into other protection businesses. This 2-part strategy leads to our 5 annual\\noperating priorities which is shown on the right side of this page and we made good progress around all 5.\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06 2020\\nIf you move to Slide 4 Allstate had strong operating and financial results in the first quarter. Total revenues of $10.1 billion\\ndeclined 8.3% for the prior year quarter due to capital losses instead of capital gains in the prior year. If you exclude the\\nimpact of the realized capital losses revenues increased 2% driven by a 4.4% increase in Property-Liability insurance\\npremiums which you can see from the table.\\nNet income of $513 million declined to the prior year quarter\\'s increased underwriting income was more than offset by\\ncapital losses and charges for pension and postretirement benefits.\\nAdjusted net income shown in the middle of the table was $1.1 billion in the quarter or $3.54 per diluted share which\\nwas significantly above the prior year reflecting lower catastrophe losses. Returns were excellent with adjusted net\\nincome return on equity improving to 18.2%.\\nMario will now discuss the first quarter results in more detail.\\nMario Rizzo\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThanks Tom and good morning everybody.\\nLet\\'s go to Slide 5 to discuss the strong performance of our Property-Liability segment. Starting with the chart on the left\\npolicy and premium growth continued with excellent recorded and underlying profitability. Underwriting income of $1.35\\nbillion in the first quarter was $645 million higher than the prior year quarter with a combined ratio of 84.9.\\nThe improvement to prior year was driven by several factors including lower catastrophe losses increased premiums\\nearned and lower auto accident frequency from the decline in miles driven. Auto accident frequency was significantly\\nlower in the quarter with property damage gross frequency down 12% compared to the prior year quarter. For the\\nmonth of March property damage gross frequency declined 27% compared to the prior year as miles driven dropped\\nsignificantly as states began implementing social distancing measures. These benefits were partially offset by increased\\nseverity and the Shelter-in-Place Payback expense.\\nThe chart on the right shows our Property-Liability expense ratio over time and specifically highlights the $210 million\\nShelter-in-Place Payback expense we recorded in the first quarter which increased the expense ratio by 2.4 points.\\nExcluding this impact the expense ratio improved by 1 point compared to the prior year quarter reflecting continued\\nprogress on enhancing the customer value proposition which is one of the key components of our Transformative Growth\\nPlan.\\nLet\\'s go to Slide 6 which highlights investment performance for the first quarter. As you\\'d expect our first quarter\\ninvestment portfolio results reflect the impact of the market volatility caused by the coronavirus. As shown in the table in\\nthe middle of the page total return for the first quarter was a negative 2.4% largely reflecting lower portfolio valuation.\\nWhile the decline in treasury rates supported fixed income prices the significant widening of credit spreads more\\nthan offset that benefit and interest-bearing valuation decline reduced return by 1.9%. Lower equity valuations further\\ndecreased returns by another 1%.\\nThe chart shows net investment income of $421 million in the quarter which was $227 million lower than the prior year.\\nWe recorded a loss of $208 million for performance-based results in the first quarter as shown in gray. As you may recall\\nthe income on our limited partnership is typically booked on a 1-quarter lag.\\nPerformance-based income related to fourth quarter 2019 sponsored financial statement was $176 million. We also\\nrecorded write-downs of $137 million on 4 underperforming private equity investments. In a typical quarter this is where\\nour process would have ended. However given market volatility and economic disruption we also recognized declines in\\nthe value of limited partnership interest where we had enough information to make informed estimates rather than solely\\nrelying on sponsored financial statement as of December 31. This included updating publicly traded investments held\\nwithin limited partnership to their March 31 market pricing which reduced investment income by $52 million.\\nWe also did not recognize $195 million of unrealized valuation increases reported in sponsor\\'s fourth quarter financial\\nstatements. The sum total of these 4 items generated the $208 million performance-based loss in Q1. Because these\\ninvestments exhibit idiosyncratic risk and return future gains and losses are uncertain. But we believe utilizing this\\napproach in the quarter is a better indication of current value.\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06 2020\\nIncome from the market-based portfolio shown in blue was lower than the prior year quarter by $19 million reflecting\\nthe impact of lower reinvestment rates. We expect this trend to continue to the extent reinvestment rates remain below\\naverage interest-bearing portfolio yield.\\nLet\\'s turn to Slide 7 to discuss our portfolio positioning. We take a disciplined and proactive approach to managing the\\ninvestment portfolio risk and return profile and our positioning has mitigated the impact of the current crisis. As you\\ncan see in the chart on the left of the page the portfolio is largely made up of high-quality fixed income securities with\\nsubstantial liquidity. We extended the duration of our Property-Liability portfolio last year which was support -- which\\nhas supported both income and returns in the lower-rate environment. We are conservatively positioned in sectors\\nmore susceptible to the pandemic and continue to monitor those exposures closely. To provide transparency into these\\nexposures we have enhanced our Form 10-Q disclosures.\\nWe also have a 13% allocation to performance-based investments and public equity securities down from 18% at year-\\nend 2019 which backed long-dated liabilities and capital. As you can see in the chart at the bottom right in February we\\nreduced our equity exposure by $4 billion primarily through the sale of public equity securities with proceeds invested in\\nhigh-quality fixed income. These trades were executed at an average price equivalent of 3281 on the S&P 500 compared\\nto the March month end level of 2585. We continue to proactively employ a disciplined risk-and-return framework to the\\nportfolio as economic conditions evolve.\\nNow let\\'s turn to Slide 8 to review results for the Life Benefits and Annuities segment. Allstate Life shown on the left\\ngenerated adjusted net income of $80 million in the first quarter an increase of $7 million compared to the prior year\\nquarter driven by lower operating costs and expenses. Allstate Benefits\\' adjusted net income of $24 million in the first\\nquarter was $7 million below the prior year quarter. The decline was due to higher operating costs and expenses driven\\nby increased investments in technology and higher DAC amortization.\\nAllstate Annuities shown on the bottom right had an adjusted net loss of $139 million in the first quarter primarily due to\\nthe performance-based investment results we discussed earlier.\\nCoronavirus claims did not appear to materially impact any of these businesses in the first quarter though we continue to\\nmonitor developments closely.\\nNow let\\'s turn to Slide 9 to talk about our Service Businesses. The Service Businesses continued to increase the number\\nof customers protected with policy in-force growth of 35.4% to 113.7 million. This is largely due to the increase in Allstate\\nProtection Plans.\\nRevenues excluding the impact of realized gains and losses grew 18.2% to $454 million in the first quarter.\\nAdjusted net income improved to $37 million in the first quarter reflecting an increase of $26 million compared to the first\\nquarter of 2019 driven by growth of Allstate Protection Plans and improved profitability at Allstate Roadside Services.\\nSlide 10 highlights Allstate\\'s attractive returns and strong capital position. While the impact of the coronavirus drove\\nfinancial market instability and led to a decline in shareholders\\' equity Allstate\\'s diversified business model substantial\\nearnings capacity and strong capital and liquidity enables us to manage effectively through this pandemic. We have $3.4\\nbillion in parent company holding deployable assets and $8.8 billion of highly liquid securities saleable within 1 week.\\nWe continued to generate strong returns on capital with an adjusted net income return on equity of 18.2% as of the end\\nof the first quarter while returning $670 million to common shareholders in the quarter through a combination of $511\\nmillion in share repurchases and $159 million in common stock dividends. We plan to continue share repurchases under\\nour current $3 billion program which is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.\\nAnd now I\\'ll turn it over to Glenn to discuss the coronavirus impact on auto insurance and how we\\'re leveraging data and\\ninsights to make decisions.\\nGlenn Thomas Shapiro\\nPresident of Personal Property-Liability of AIC\\nThanks Mario and good morning everyone. Let\\'s go to Slide 11 which looks at the potential impacts of coronavirus on\\nauto insurance. Profit has been and will be impacted by a reduction in miles driven which will lower overall loss costs.\\nWhile this has been significant it will decline over time as the economy begins to reopen and there are several offsets.\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06 2020\\nFirst the reduction of drivers on the road has increased driving speeds which can lead to increased severity per claim.\\nWe\\'ll also likely incur additional bad debt from some customers who have chosen to take extended payment terms.\\nOn a longer-term basis if the global auto parts supply chain is disrupted or parts prices are raised by auto manufacturers\\nthis could increase repair costs. The pandemic and economic slowdown will also impact growth. If loss costs continue to\\nbe below prior year the lower required rate increases will limit average premium growth.\\nOn the positive side the Shelter-in-Place payment could have a favorable impact on retention.\\nThe impact on new business is unclear since reduced vehicle sales can lower new business but economic conditions\\nmay increase shopping levels. And we\\'ve seen an increased customer interest in telematics and we\\'re well positioned\\nwith both Drivewise and Milewise the latter of which charges customers\\' insurance by mile. Getting ahead of these trends\\nwill be important to grow profitably as we continue to manage profitability and competitive position on a market-by-market\\nbasis and will enable us to be precise in our responses.\\nLet\\'s now move to Slide 12. As a customer of Arity we have access not only to our data but insights from a much broader\\ndata set some of which is shown on this slide. Telematics-based pricing allows you to factor in things like how much\\nsomeone drives where they drive and how they drive.\\nOur telematics products enable us to do that for individual customers which when combined with a broader set of data\\nenables us to make better judgments market by market.\\nFor example based on 3.5 billion trips from February through April the upper-left graph shows that miles driven declined\\nsharply in mid-March and then began a slow increase since then. You can also see that those states that had stay-at-\\nhome orders had a bigger decline in driving.\\nIn the upper right you can see there\\'s also a difference between rural areas at the top of the chart which declined by\\nabout 20% and urban areas at the bottom which declined by about 50%. The bottom-left graph shows that while some\\ndrivers are not driving at all those are the bars to the left about 20% of drivers are actually driving more than they did\\nbefore mid-March.\\nArity also provides a Drivesight score which is a measure of driving risk. The lower the score the higher the risk. As you\\ncan see on the bottom right the mean risk has increased despite fewer cars on the road which correlates to the data\\nthat shows some drivers are driving faster. The net of all of this is that Allstate has the data and business processes to\\nproactively adjust to a changing operating environment.\\nI\\'ll now pass it back to Tom.\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nThank you Glenn.\\nTo move to Slide 13 we want to discuss how we\\'ve moved past the emergency of moving people to work from home\\nto the immediate of creating a Shelter-in-Place Payback to implementing intermediate-term actions. In this type of\\nenvironment you obviously have to look where you step but you also have to decide where you want to walk. And as we\\nlook into the future there\\'s not that much clarity right? Who will move back into offices? Will as many people still need\\nto commute to work? What happens to the investment market? And of course the answer is nobody knows. There are\\nso many possibilities you can get frozen into inaction. So we used scenario planning to see what the future path look like\\nunder alternative assumptions.\\nThis came out of Royal Dutch Shell in the \\'70s and it works kind of like this. You find 2 things that will be the primary\\ndrivers of change. In this case we selected the length and depth of the health crisis which is shown at the top of the box\\non the bottom of that page and the severity of the economic downturn from disruptive to severe which is shown on the\\nvertical axis. You then create 4 scenarios to represent a range of possible outcomes.\\nAs you can see from the slide the best case in the upper right we\\'ve labeled Sigh of Relief. The health care crisis is over\\nrelatively quickly and the economy is disrupted but government support enables us to bounce back with them. In the\\nworst case in the lower right is distracted by the virus. It reflects a significant health impact with repeated lockdowns over\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc.

The decline in GDP is greater than The Great Depression but it doesn\\'t last as long because of\\nthe government fiscal monetary action.\\nFor each scenario then we look at a range of outcomes including consumer behavior auto insurance accidents and\\ninvestment returns. This helps us decide what actions we should do even though we do not know what the ultimate\\noutcome will be. It also helps inform what not to do. And it enables us to establish road signs for each scenario which\\nimproves our ability to forecast the direction we\\'re headed. There are of course similar consequences in the scenarios\\nwhich help determine what actions to take which is shown on Slide 14.\\nIn many of the outcomes revenue growth is constrained because of fewer auto accidents deteriorating incomes\\nincreased unemployment or lower interest rates. As a result we are accelerating our Transformative Growth Plan\\nwhich will improve customer value with increased utilization of new technologies lower costs and new auto insurance\\nproducts. And as you know well the investment markets will be more volatile in many of these scenarios. As a result\\nwe\\'re evaluating our strategic asset allocation.\\nMany of us have found that we can adopt new technologies pretty quickly. Like who knew you can have so many Zoom\\nor Teams or Skype meetings in one day? As a result we\\'re going to maintain a strong commitment to telematics and\\nexpanding the Integrated Digital Enterprise.\\nConsumer behavior is also likely to change to focus on the quality and breadth of their protection. And this is where\\nAllstate is headed with the second part of our strategy is to provide a broader array of protection offerings from auto\\ninsurance to include things like your phone and your identity.\\nNow we\\'ll open the line for questions.\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06 2020\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.\\nElyse Beth Greenspan\\nWells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division\\nMy first question is just on frequency. You guys provided some pretty good disclosure on the drop in miles driven and I\\nbelieve you said it started to bounce back from the COVID woes. So as we\\'re thinking about Q2 so April and May kind\\nof to date how do you think about the frequency benefit that we might see over that period compared to what you saw\\ntowards the later stages of March?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nElyse let me start and then toss it over to Glenn. Well it is -- obviously as people start to drive more they\\'ll get in more\\naccidents. So we expect that to head up. Where it will end up is hard to predict at this point because you don\\'t really know\\nwhen people are going to go back to the office and how many people will even go back to the office site.\\nIt is -- as I talk to other companies it\\'s pretty clear to me that we found that we\\'ve built the infrastructure to do remote\\nworkforce. At Allstate we\\'ve already had about 15% of our people remote before this. We think we can probably do more.\\nSo that would obviously lead to fewer people driving to and from work but it\\'s hard to predict exactly where the number\\ncomes out. Glenn do you have anything you want to add to that?\\nGlenn Thomas Shapiro\\nPresident of Personal Property-Liability of AIC\\nNot too much. I think Tom -- as Tom said you\\'ve got some unknowns in there which would include if you go on the other\\nside of it some pent-up demand. If you think about people who postponed trips who postponed visiting relatives and\\nwant to catch up on it so you could have some sort of fits and starts with some of the long-lasting as Tom described\\ndownward pressure on driving and therefore frequency but also some potential short-term bubbles where people want to\\nget out there because they\\'re a little bit stir-crazy.\\nElyse Beth Greenspan\\nWells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division\\nOkay. That\\'s helpful. And then my second question is on buybacks. I know you guys have said you expect to maintain\\nyour buyback program. So as we think about the completion of that program I believe it runs through the end of 2021\\nshould we think about kind of an even pace of buybacks from here? Would there be some slowdown over the next couple\\nof quarters? Or just given the capital position you kind of expect that to be evenly maintained as we work our way through\\n2021?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nMario will you take that question?\\nMario Rizzo\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nSure. Elyse thanks for the questions. So I think the place I\\'d start Elyse is we feel really good about our capital and\\nliquidity position $3.4 billion of holding company assets $8.8 billion of readily available liquidity $3.7 billion of dividend\\ncapacity out of our insurance companies into the holding company for the year. And our businesses are performing really\\nwell.\\nSo I think I\\'d say we expect to complete the program by the end of next year just like our Board authorized. And we\\'ve\\ngot a lot of flexibility in terms of how we execute it but we would expect to just continue to buy back shares over that time\\nperiod.\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06 2020\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James.\\nCharles Gregory Peters\\nRaymond James & Associates Inc. Research Division\\nFirst question will be on the expense ratio the underlying expense ratio improvement. Can you talk about what -- and you\\nprovided just a basic comment on it in your prepared remarks. Can you give us more color on that? And maybe talk about\\nmaybe how that fits with the sequential decline in Allstate Agency\\'s and LSPs? And is that part of your integrated services\\nplatform rollout?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nMario why don\\'t you take expenses? And Glenn will you take the agent?\\nMario Rizzo\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes sure. So when you look at the expense ratio in the quarter you saw a 1 point sequential decline year-over-year in the\\nexpense ratio. And first thing I\\'d say is reducing our cost continues to be a core part of our transformative growth strategy.\\nAnd when you kind of deconstruct where the improvement came from it\\'s about 50-50 not quite between acquisition\\ncosts and operating costs.\\nAnd obviously those are 2 core parts of our cost structure and we saw improvement in both. And we\\'re going to continue\\nto be focused on reducing those costs going forward to enhance our competitive position to still take growth and be a core\\npart of transformative growth for us.\\nWe\\'re also going to continue to invest in the things we need to invest in for transformative growth things like technology\\nand marketing. But we\\'re focused going forward on continuing to reduce costs over time.\\nI\\'ll turn it over to Glenn to talk a little bit about the agency part of it.\\nGlenn Thomas Shapiro\\nPresident of Personal Property-Liability of AIC\\nYes. Greg thanks for the question. In terms of the LSP count and agent count you hit on part of it in your question with\\nintegrated service. When you look at licensed sales professionals and in spite of the word sales being the operative word\\nthere they spend only about 40% of their time on sales about 60% on service. That\\'s been a historic number.\\nAnd one of the things we\\'re committed to is taking a lot of the transactional work out both through self-service capabilities\\nas well as integrated service over time so that they\\'re increasing that percentage of time they\\'re selling and not having\\nto do as much of that transactional work. So we\\'ll probably see that change over time. And that\\'s really part of our overall\\ntransformative growth work that we\\'re doing.\\nAnd in terms of the agency count we\\'re really focused on growth and growing with quality in terms of the agency\\nforce. So coming into this year I think everybody knew we changed compensation a little bit where we moved variable\\ncompensation from renewal to new part of it. And we also increased expectations for production on our agency force\\nbecause we really want to grow with those agents that are looking to invest and grow in their business.\\nCharles Gregory Peters\\nRaymond James & Associates Inc. Research Division\\nThe next -- my follow-up question is on the investment portfolio. First of all as an observer I have to acknowledge the\\nbrilliance of your decision to sell the public equities in February. It\\'s stunning. But as I look at the adjustments you made to\\nthe limited partnerships do you think that this is a permanent change to your valuation approach on a quarterly basis? Or\\n-- and I guess the other adjacent question was -- would be that in your adjustments to the first quarter results on LPs did\\nit include an assessment for all of the LPs or 100% of the portfolio? Or what percentage of the portfolio wasn\\'t covered by\\nyour valuation reassessments?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06 2020\\nChairman President & CEO\\nGreg thank you for the comment on equity. I just want to be clear. It was done on a risk and return basis. So we just\\nlooked at the capital up on it. We looked at the prospective outlook and we decided that wasn\\'t as good a return on those\\n-- on the amount of capital we had to have up on equity.\\nWe obviously -- it was good timing but it wasn\\'t like we knew the market crash was coming. But it also shows the benefit\\nof having business processes that are metric-driven that you stick to them whether that\\'s the way you invest or what\\nGlenn was talking about in terms of how our business processes and our metrics work for changing frequency by state\\nand doing pricing by state.\\nMario will you take the question on accounting on this performance-based investment?\\nMario Rizzo\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nSure Tom. So Greg I guess where I\\'d start is as we\\'ve said in the past generally we record performance-based income\\non a 1-quarter lag based on the partner financial statements as of the prior quarter end. So for example in the first\\nquarter we would have relied on year-end partner financial statements. And that\\'s typically how we would approach the\\naccounting.\\nHowever our accounting policy does require that when a material market event occurs and we have information available\\nto make informed estimates that we need to take that information into account. And that\\'s what we did this quarter. So we\\nmade the 2 adjustments the -- marking the public equity holdings in some of the partnership holdings to March 31 levels\\nand then suppressing the increases in unrealized valuation on securities that were reflected in the year-end financial\\nstatement. We did that because that\\'s part of the accounting policy because there was a material market event in the\\nquarter.\\nThe other piece was the -- just our normal watchlist process where we go through every holding. And to the extent we\\nbelieve we need to impair a holding we do that. And that was worth $137 million in the quarter on 4 specific holdings. So\\nabsent another market disruption event let\\'s say hopefully we avoid one this quarter we\\'ll go back to what our typical\\nprocess would be. But because there was this disruption event in the first quarter our policy required that if we had\\nadditional information that we could make good estimates based on we should do that. And that\\'s exactly what we did.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler.\\nJon Paul Newsome\\nPiper Sandler & Co. Research Division\\nI was hoping you could talk a little bit about or give us some color on where the acceleration will come in the\\nTransformative Growth Plan? What will change? You mentioned you\\'re thinking of accelerating it.\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nThanks Paul. It is -- obviously it\\'s a multifaceted program right? The idea is to increase customer access. And that was\\nputting together the -- using the Esurance capabilities on direct under the Allstate brand to expand there. It\\'s to reduce\\nour cost structure and it\\'s to use technology to enable us to launch new products and lower our cost structure. So the --\\nGlenn can talk about the progress on Esurance and the Allstate brand and that\\'s been great. And we\\'re headed down the\\npath to have start operating under the Allstate brand on a direct basis this year.\\nThe -- on the cost reduction it will accelerate some of the stuff we do on cost reduction and it will also accelerate some\\nof the work we\\'re doing on building new technologies particularly as it looks things like Milewise and Drivewise. Before\\nwhen you sold insurance by the mile we\\'re I think one of the few large companies that do that. The people didn\\'t really\\nknow what it\\'s about today with Shelter-in-Place Payback from us or the actions of our competitors. People are paying\\nattention now and saying \"Oh maybe I do want to pay by the mile.\" So we will push harder on the new product efforts as\\nwell.\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06 2020\\nGlenn do you want to pick up the Esurance and Allstate brand part? And maybe talk as well about the Esurance growth in\\nthe first quarter since that may be on people\\'s mind as it relates to transformative growth.\\nGlenn Thomas Shapiro\\nPresident of Personal Property-Liability of AIC\\nYes. So I\\'ll start with the Esurance growth piece and then I\\'ll go into the -- what we\\'re doing as far as the transformation\\nbecause really transformative growth and the brand changes had nothing to do with the growth in the first quarter. It was\\nactually a 3-part story. Esurance was having increased loss trends in the latter part of last year. We needed to take some\\npricing and underwriting actions. We did which is good because we\\'ve gotten the profitability in line as a result. But what\\ntypically happens with that is you take a little bit of a hit on your retention and your new business as that happens. And\\nthat was happening towards the very end of the year and into January.\\nNow once those prices have worked their way through we actually reinvested some marketing. We were doing pretty well\\nin February and early March when quoting kind of fell off the table in the middle of March. So you have these sort of 3\\nwindows to like a slow start in January some really nice momentum in February early March and then everything fell off\\nthe table there for a few weeks.\\nFortunately as we\\'ve seen from external indices shopping has returned and is expected to actually accelerate going\\nforward. So we\\'ve got some good optimism there as to how it moves forward in terms of Esurance growth.\\nIn terms of transformative growth and where we\\'re going Jonathan Adkisson who\\'s the President of Esurance and took\\nover now as our head of the direct business has been working with both teams and bringing it together in such a way that\\nwe increase or improve our sales process under the Allstate brand. We improve our online quote flow. And so those are\\nalready in process and happening on a day-by-day basis. It\\'s a continuous improvement effort. What is still to come is our\\npivot on branding and how we invest in marketing for the Allstate brand to go to market as both a direct and agency-driven\\nbrand as well as our work with online leads.\\nJon Paul Newsome\\nPiper Sandler & Co. Research Division\\nSomewhat relatedly could you talk a little bit about what happened with retention? Did it also have a kind of similar 3\\ndifferent periods like the sales did during the quarter?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nGlenn will you take that?\\nGlenn Thomas Shapiro\\nPresident of Personal Property-Liability of AIC\\nSure. Retention I would say no. Retention really -- there\\'s no impact yet from coronavirus because it\\'s kind of a lagging\\nmetric. It includes midterm cancellations that you\\'re measuring at the point of when they would have renewed.\\nSo to the extent that we see impact whether favorable or unfavorable from coronavirus I think we\\'ll see that on a go-\\nforward basis from a retention standpoint. We still are in a pretty good space from a retention standpoint. We\\'re down\\nyear-over-year but off of a fairly high watermark still running 88% retention in auto and feel fairly good about where we\\nare. And we continue to work hard to do well for our customers. I think our response to coronavirus and the multiple areas\\nthat we were very quick to respond for customers can and hopefully should help us from a retention standpoint and it\\'s\\nsomething we continue to work at.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore.\\nDavid Kenneth Motemaden\\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities Research Division\\nJust a question for Tom on investments. And you mentioned -- just in terms of reducing the equity allocation during the\\nquarter you mentioned you looked at the return and the capital required and decided to reduce it. I guess are there -- I\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 12\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06 2020\\nguess how are you thinking about the allocation to equities and LPs at 13% of the portfolio going forward? Do you expect\\nto do more of this? And maybe if you could help me understand how much capital that freed up by reducing the $4 billion\\nworth of equities?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nOkay David. Thank you for the growth time question. I\\'ll talk about the logic for the equity. John can then talk about the\\nprocess we\\'re looking at in terms of going forward which you talked about at the end is -- which is really your question\\nwhere should you invest in this kind of environment? And the answer is we don\\'t know but we\\'ve got a pretty good\\nprocess going to figure out what we think is the best option.\\nFirst the equities. A large portion of the equity portfolio back to payout annuities which are long-dated liabilities think of\\nthem like a pension plan. And so you don\\'t want to be invested in fixed income for annuities that are going to pay out in\\n10 20 30 years. So that\\'s appropriately at the liability match. And that\\'s sort of a bottom. We don\\'t want to move away\\nfrom that matching because it would be bad long term economically. And you don\\'t want to start to be picking when you\\ntrade in or out.\\nOn the other hand some of our equities just are capital that we use to support the business and that we are a little more\\nflexible with. And we brought down the -- when we look at economic capital which is amount of capital we think we need\\nto put up for risk we thought we had -- it wasn\\'t a good enough return for us. So that was why we reduced it which is\\nreally related to sort of the equity portfolio of the overall entity not specific asset liability matching.\\nAs it relates to the amount of freed up capital David from a statutory capital standpoint it obviously reduces your capital\\na little bit. But we\\'re long capital as it is. And so we don\\'t look at it as though we had to free up capital to buy shares back\\nor anything like that. We just look at it pure economics. What\\'s the right thing to do for shareholders on a long-term basis?\\nAnd it did free up some economic capital some statutory capital but it doesn\\'t really make a difference in the amount of\\ncapital we have available to either do share repurchases or buy something like that.\\nJohn do you want to spend a minute on what we\\'re doing on the strategic asset allocation?\\nUnknown Executive\\nYes. Thanks Tom. And David thank you for your question. As a regular matter of course we take a disciplined approach\\nto investing and thoroughly look at the -- managing both the risk and return trade-offs. We do that both directly in the\\ninvestment department but then that\\'s highly integrated with the way we think about return and risk opportunities across\\nthe firm as Tom had mentioned.\\nOne of the key things that we do is first we have a -- what I believe to be a strong team of about 400 investment\\nprofessionals and -- that are deeply experienced. And we are in a number of different markets and look at price action\\nfundamental economic drivers technical observations across those markets. We also bring in on a regular basis keen\\ninsight from people from the outside whether that\\'s from our dealer relationships whether that\\'s via specific consultants\\nor economic research teams that we have subscriptions to and try and formulate at any point in time the best risk return\\ntrade-off for the portfolio especially given the business lines that we\\'re associated with.\\nAs Tom mentioned if you -- candidly if you go back a little more than a year ago we started to see that the return per unit\\nof risk as we perceived it in the marketplace was flattening out and we became a little bit more concerned about whether\\ninvestment markets offer the best opportunity. What transpired since then is that the Fed became pretty active last year\\nas we\\'ve all seen. We took that as an opportunity to add duration to the portfolio which is paying benefits today. So it\\'s\\ntantamount to our desire to be proactive with our investment portfolio and integrate it to the rest of the firm.\\nAs we moved into the end of this year one of the things that we noticed is that there was a limit to what the central banks\\ncould do to continue to push on returns of growth assets or risky assets. We thought that what we had observed in 2019 is\\nnot much earnings growth and there is a fair amount of multiple growth. And we just thought that that was likely coming\\ninto the end. As Tom said we really didn\\'t predict that there\\'s going to be an event. But the one thing we all recognize\\nas an enterprise that if there was an event we weren\\'t really giving much compensation for that. So we incorporated this\\nequity trade in February albeit at very good levels.\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 13\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06 2020\\nThe way that we accomplish this on a daily -- on a regular basis and quarterly we sit down in an investment group and\\nwe go through what we call a capital allocation process. And we spend 2 3 days deeply looking at markets and then we\\nshare that with the rest of the enterprise.\\nDavid Kenneth Motemaden\\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities Research Division\\nGot it. And if I could just one follow-up. Just on the expense ratio the 23.4 in the quarter how should I think about that for\\nthe rest of the year just given potential top line pressure offset by what sounds like ramp-up of the transformative growth\\nas the year progresses?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nMario do you want to take that?\\nMario Rizzo\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nSure. Again what I\\'d say is I\\'d reiterate. Look a core part of our strategy is to continue to look to take costs out of the\\nsystem and the general downward view of our expense ratio to improve competitive position.\\nHaving said that you did say you articulated a couple of the items that are going to cause some choppiness in that.\\nNumber one is the outlook on revenue which there\\'s uncertainty around that but also we\\'re going to continue to make\\ninvestments in things like I said technology and marketing. So I guess what I\\'d say is look our focus is still on reducing\\ncosts and driving the expense ratio down over time.\\nI\\'m not going to sit here today and give you an exact trajectory of what that\\'s going to look like. But strategically that\\ncontinues to be a core part of what we\\'re trying to do.\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nSo what we try to do is manage it down but not do it stupidly right? So like as Glenn mentioned we have to reposition\\nthe Allstate brand to go even more aggressive into driving the direct growth. And that\\'s going to cost some money.\\nSo we\\'ll do what we think is economic for shareholders. And then we think if we do it on an upfront it works out so we\\nachieve our overall objective.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar from JPMorgan.\\nJamminder Singh Bhullar\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co Research Division\\nSo I had a couple of questions. First maybe just on the auto business if you could talk about competition as you\\'re\\nlooking at the business through the rest of the year. Everyone\\'s margins are actually obviously pretty strong. Do you see\\nat some point companies start to adjust pricing based on sort of whatever the new normal is in terms of driving behavior?\\nAnd have you seen any indication of companies getting a little bit looser on renewal terms recently?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nLet me start maybe talk about process Jimmy and Glenn can fill in some specific thoughts he has. So it\\'s -- obviously\\nwe did the Shelter-in-Place Payback and everybody followed relatively quickly. That doesn\\'t mean that we really only\\nhave the idea it just means that everybody thought that with margins where they were it was fair to give it back to\\ncustomers or at least that was our view.\\nAnd whether that people will continue to do that or not it\\'s hard to tell. What I do know is that because we have a\\nbusiness model which is run by market by line by coverage with all kinds of data both our telematics data our own\\nhistorical data our claim data and the information we get from Arity will be incredibly precise and surgical about the way\\nwe react. I can\\'t speak to what other people do.\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 14\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06 2020\\nGlenn is there anything in the competitive environment that is clearer today than -- and has been kind of murky is I would\\nsay but anything you would add to that?\\nGlenn Thomas Shapiro\\nPresident of Personal Property-Liability of AIC\\nYes. What I would say is we\\'re clearly going to be in a very benign rate environment that might be an understatement\\nand -- for some period of time. What I haven\\'t seen is in the competitive environment anybody making a more durable\\nor permanent change to their premiums meaning a rate reduction that is over a permanent price filing for rate reduction.\\nBecause I think like us I\\'m sure others see that like this came on fast. Like I don\\'t think anybody predicted that when we\\ncame into this year we were going to have an event that would drive mileage down by 50% or whatever the numbers are\\nby state. And it can go away fast too.\\nSo I think everybody\\'s looking at this I know we are from the standpoint of how do we react in real time make good\\ndecisions doing the right thing by market with precision as Tom said with our customers in mind but not do anything\\nthat we then have to rebound on. And it wouldn\\'t be good for anybody to overplay it a hand and then have to go take rate\\nincreases afterwards.\\nSo I think what you\\'re going to see is a very benign flat rate environment as opposed to a negative one.\\nJamminder Singh Bhullar\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co Research Division\\nAnd then on the sales or top line growth environment in sort of the Services Benefits or Life businesses should we\\nassume that because the COVID and sort of Shelter-in-Place that you\\'ll see a drop-off in sales in some of these\\nbusinesses in the near term?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nLet me have Don answer about the Services Business particularly Allstate Protection plans which as you saw is just\\ncontinuing to grow incredibly rapidly. And I hate for that story to get lost amongst the coronavirus part. And then I would\\njust -- I think I could summarize it to say in Life that we haven\\'t had much growth there in the last couple of years and\\nwe\\'re really trying to still reboot that growth strategy.\\nDon do you want to...\\nDogan Civgin\\nChief Executive Officer of Protection Products & Services- AIC\\nSure. So I think obviously each of the businesses are going to be impacted by different trends. Some of them will be\\ndriven by frequency such as our roadside business. Some will be driven by auto sales and kind of general economic\\nconditions like a dealer services and so forth. So I think every business will be impacted by some different factors.\\nAllstate Protection Plans which has continued to have terrific growth first on a broader level they\\'ve been growing for\\na number of quarters. So this is not unique to the first quarter of 2020. And so we\\'ve been really pleased with the overall\\ngrowth and overall improvement in profitability that they\\'ve been able to exhibit.\\nNow when you look at the first quarter you might look and say \"Well their -- most of their sales are through retail and\\nretail is suffering\" which is maybe true in general but you have to get a little bit more nuance and look at the types of\\ncustomers they have the types of retailers we do business with and to some extent what\\'s being purchased at retail right\\nnow.\\nSo when you look at SquareTrade\\'s kind of largest B2B customers they tend to be the larger one-stop shops where\\npeople have been going to shop more frequently since coronavirus hit because they want to get all of their purchases\\ndone with one stop if they can do so.\\nSecond a lot of what\\'s been purchased as people have been adapting to the home environment has been kind of getting\\nhome offices set up to some extent entertainment setup because they\\'re going to be stuck in their houses for some\\nperiod of time which obviously come with the opportunity for extended warranties as well as the stimulus check impact\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 15\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06 2020\\nwhich put funds in people\\'s pockets to be able to then go out and spend. So when you look at what their particular type of\\ncustomer was looking for the first quarter after coronavirus saw a nice increase.\\nIt\\'s hard to tell whether that will last and how long that will last but I think at some point the overall trends in retail will be\\na headwind for Allstate Protection Plans. But at least in the short term it\\'s actually been a nice tailwind. I would also say\\nthat new business which they\\'ve picked up a number of large accounts recently both domestically and overseas rollouts\\nof those programs have slowed down a little bit as people have been trying to figure out how they\\'re going to get those\\nstores open. And there was a slight I would say in the first quarter benefit from claims dip as people submitted fewer\\nclaims after the virus hit for some period of time.\\nSo overall trends continue to be really strong. Hard to tell what the impact is going to be on Allstate Protection Plans long\\nterm from the virus. But in kind of the immediate term it\\'s been good for their top line.\\nJamminder Singh Bhullar\\nJP Morgan Chase & Co Research Division\\nOkay. And just lastly any comments you have on long-term strategy for the annuity block and the likelihood of a scale or\\nreinsurance of that business?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nSure. Let me jump at that Jimmy. First on the -- I should also point out on more longitudinal perspective Allstate\\nProtection Plans now has over 100 million policies in force. Don I think it was about 30-plus when we bought it right -- 30\\nmillion plus.\\nDogan Civgin\\nChief Executive Officer of Protection Products & Services- AIC\\nYes.\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nSo it\\'s had a tremendous run not to be swept under the carpet. It\\'s really a great team. As it relates to annuities it\\'s a\\nhuge drag on our ROE because we -- as I mentioned earlier we have a lot of equities behind that portfolio because we\\nbelieve that\\'s the right thing to do. So our 18.2% includes a large drag on it from the annuities. If we could find a way to\\neliminate that drag we would do so. But we only want to do it with some place where our customers will be well taken\\ncare of because this is largely written on our paper. And we don\\'t want to give somebody a whole bunch of investments\\nand say \"Good luck and we hope you pay the people off when you get there.\" And they do something stupid.\\nSo we are managing it well as it is today. Either we will find a solution that could be a reinsurance solution it could be a\\nsale it could be we just keep it we run it differently. In any event it will go away in terms of its drag on ROE when the new\\nlong-dated accounting -- long-dated annuity accounting comes in place where you\\'ll have to mark that to market. We don\\'t\\n-- we think that that accounting is a little rough. On the other hand it will eliminate the drag on overall ROE.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Crédit Suisse.\\nCharles W. Lederer\\nCrédit Suisse AG Research Division\\nThis is actually Charlie on for Mike. Can you talk about your commercial lines exposures outside of commercial auto? And\\nspecifically can you talk about business interruption exposure in general whether you\\'ve seen claims and if your policies\\nhave virus exclusions?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nDon any report?\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 16\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06 2020\\nDogan Civgin\\nChief Executive Officer of Protection Products & Services- AIC\\nOkay. Charlie so in our business insurance we do actually have exclusions for disruption caused by the pandemic and\\nso we -- like many others do. And so there\\'s a lot of noise out there about implementing requirements for insurance\\ncompanies to go back and provide coverages that were not only excluded explicitly but were also not priced for.\\nAnd so we would be against obviously that.\\nHaving said that our exposure is relatively small. There\\'s about 60000 policies in total that we have that sort of exposure\\nwhich as I said is explicitly excluded. So it\\'s a relatively small number for a company like Allstate.\\nCharles W. Lederer\\nCrédit Suisse AG Research Division\\nGot it. And then on the Shelter-in-Place Payback included in the expense ratio in the first quarter does that imply the\\ncharge for the second quarter will be the balance to get to the $600 million you guys have talked about? And is there\\na potential for further premium reductions either larger discounts per month or an extension of the duration of the\\ndiscounts?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nMario if you\\'ll take the second -- the first piece and then make sure we talk about all the other things whether it\\'s bad\\ndebts or anything else coming up in the quarter. As it -- Charlie as it relates to another Shelter-in-Place program what we\\nsaid is we\\'re always going to treat our customers fairly. This came along quickly. We moved within 10 days to get people\\nwhat was a relatively easier to implement in terms of it ubiquitous across the country ubiquitous by customer. Everybody\\ngot 15% in April and May. And we felt we needed to do that because they were all struggling. The government money had\\nnot yet come into people\\'s home. So we even provided the opportunity for them to get cash even though they might have\\ngone on a deferred payment plan with us.\\nAnd so that was -- it was done because we need -- knew our customers needed help and we need to do it fast. If\\nfrequency were to stay down because of something that was not continuous so we thought it was Shelter-in-Place for\\na longer period of time when you look at those graphs that Glenn showed. If it stayed down there we may want to do\\nsomething else for our customers to reflect the fact that they\\'re not driving as much. This time though it will be much more\\nprecise. And so we\\'ll use all the data we have to -- as Glenn talked about some people are driving more but it doesn\\'t\\nfeel like they should get a Shelter-in-Place Payback right? It doesn\\'t seem as fair to somebody who\\'s not driving the car at\\nall.\\nThe same thing about which area you live in you live in an urban area or rural area. Is your -- what kind of driving? Are\\nyou a really fast driver? Now not everybody\\'s on telematics so we can\\'t get it as precise as we would like. But we are\\nworking on a more comprehensive approach should frequency stay down and we will do what we think is fair for our\\ncustomers.\\nMario do you want to take the second quarter impact from what we\\'ve already done?\\nMario Rizzo\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nSure. So on -- with respect to the SIPP payment we saw we recorded a portion of it in the first quarter. The balance will\\nbe recorded in the second quarter. So that one\\'s pretty straightforward. That will happen. When we kind of decided on\\nthe SIPP payment one of the things we explicitly factored in was the potential for bad debt expense associated with the\\nspecial payment plan that we\\'re allowing our customers to opt into. As we evaluated the number of customers that had\\nopted into that as of the end of March along with our historical bad debt experience the impact in the first quarter from a\\nbad debt perspective was pretty immaterial.\\nObviously we will look at the number of customers that have signed up as well as the exposure going forward. And\\nwe\\'ll take that into account in the second quarter in terms of establishing bad debt prospectively. But first quarter was\\nreasonably immaterial. Second quarter we\\'ll take a look at the analysis. We\\'ll update it appropriately and then we\\'ll\\nrecord something incremental in the second quarter.\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc.

Research Division\\nJust want to go back to distribution a little bit. Can you maybe talk about how the agency channel is impacted by Shelter-\\nin-Place environment and the -- with customers potentially looking for lower price options as well? And with that maybe\\nalso touch on kind of the timing of shifting the agent variable compensation to a -- more to a new business generation and\\nhow that has been impacting the sales force?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nGlenn will be the best person to answer that question.\\nGlenn Thomas Shapiro\\nPresident of Personal Property-Liability of AIC\\nAll right. Thanks Yaron. First of all when you think about the impacts of coronavirus I think it\\'s important there\\'s all\\ndifferent types of businesses that have to close down all the way up through businesses that actually benefit because\\nthey\\'re in the type of business that wins in this type of new environment. The agents kind of fall in the middle of that\\nbecause if you think about their revenue stream it is still significantly renewal compensation. Our total compensation to\\nthe agency force and if you break down to any individual agent will range somewhere between 90% and 100% or in\\nsome cases even above 100%. Some are growing more post middle of March versus before. So the core of their income\\nremains. So you\\'ve got that piece.\\nIn terms of how it impacts their business I think that that will be something to watch and something to see. I agree that\\npeople will be looking for value as they go forward. But I also think our agents have really been able to show their value\\nin this process. I don\\'t think there\\'s another time in our company history where I could make the following statement: Over\\nthe course of the last 6 weeks almost all of our agents have called almost all of their customers. So you\\'ve got this really\\nunique period of time where a people are more available to be reached; b they have more questions and they really\\nwant to hear from their trusted adviser; and c our folks are just committed to that because of a national crisis.\\nAnd so I think that there\\'s this moment in time where at least some portion of our customer base will really see the value\\nof what they\\'ve gotten out of their agency relationship and having a trusted adviser. That said everything Mario and Tom\\nand others have talked about on this call about transformative growth is we\\'ve got to keep taking costs out of our system\\nand be a more affordable and more competitive value for consumers going forward which is why we\\'re accelerating the\\nTransformative Growth Plan.\\nYaron Joseph Kinar\\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. Research Division\\nGot it. Understood. And then maybe one quick follow-up. Milewise you talked about potentially accelerating it. I think as of\\nyear-end you were in 14 states. Any thoughts as to how quickly you can really expand the program to all 50 states?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nGlenn do you want to give an update on that?\\nGlenn Thomas Shapiro\\nPresident of Personal Property-Liability of AIC\\nYes. So we\\'re in 16 states and moving as quickly as we can on it. Certainly the pandemic has shown a light on the value\\nof a pay-per-mile product and we\\'re seeing a nice uptick in the demand for it. You see kind of 2 effects in the public right\\nnow. One is just the acceptance of the notion that telematics is going up as a result of all of this and two is actually the\\nover-demand for something like Milewise is going up. We have some states up 30% in terms of their sales since the\\nmiddle of March and seeing double-digit percentages regularly on a week-by-week basis of the new business being sold\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc.

It will absolutely be part of our filings that we\\'re\\ndoing broadly across the country to try to expand and do more for consumers as a result of the pandemic.\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nOkay. Thank you all. Allstate is in a strong position. We know how to protect our customers from life\\'s uncertainties\\nand we\\'ll continue to do that as we navigate through this crisis.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder today\\'s program is being recorded. And\\nnow I\\'d like to introduce your host for today\\'s program Mr. Mark Nogal Head of Investor Relations.\\nPlease go ahead sir.\\nMark Nogal;Head of Investor Relations\\nThank you Jonathan. Good morning and welcome everyone to Allstate\\'s Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings\\nConference Call. After prepared remarks we will have a question-and-answer session. Yesterday following\\nthe close of the market we issued our news release and investor supplement and posted today\\'s\\npresentation on our website at allstateinvestors.com.\\nOur management team is here to provide perspective on these results and further context on our recently\\nannounced transformative growth plan. As noted on the first slide of the presentation our discussion\\nwill contain non-GAAP measures for which there are reconciliations in the news release and investor\\nsupplement and forward-looking statements about Allstate\\'s operations.\\nAllstate\\'s results may differ materially from these statements so please refer to our 10-K for 2018 and\\nother public documents for information on potential risks. And now I\\'ll turn it over to Tom.\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nWell good morning. Thank you for joining us to stay current on Allstate. Let\\'s begin on Slide 2 with\\nAllstate\\'s strategy. So as you know our strategy has 2 components: increased personal Property-Liability\\nmarket share; and expand into other protection businesses. Starting with the upper oval we\\'ve been a\\nleader in creating differentiated insurance products and features such as declining deductibles and new\\ncar replacement. We use sophisticated pricing have strong claims expertise and are building an integrated\\ndigital enterprise to lower costs. We\\'re also diversifying our businesses by expanding our protection\\nofferings which are highlighted in the bottom oval.\\nWe leverage the Allstate brand customer base and capabilities to drive growth in these businesses. So we\\noffer customers a circle of protection that includes Allstate Life workplace benefits commercial insurance\\nRoadside Services car warranties Protection Plans and Identity Protection.\\nThese growth platforms have extremely broad distribution and includes major retailers insurance brokers\\nat the work site auto dealers manufacturers telcos and directly to consumers. On the right hand you\\ncan see that this strategy creates shareholder value through customer satisfaction unit growth and\\nattractive returns on capital. It also ensures we have sustainable profitability and a diversified business\\nplatform.\\nWe move to Slide 3. Allstate\\'s strategy continued to deliver excellent results in 2019. Revenues were\\nnearly $11.5 billion in the fourth quarter and $44.7 billion for the full year 2019. Net income was $1.7\\nbillion in the fourth quarter and $4.7 billion in the full year. Adjusted net income was $1.02 billion or $3.13\\nper diluted share in the fourth quarter.\\nFor the full year adjusted net income rose 11.1% compared to the prior year to $3.48 billion or $10.43\\nper share. That reflects excellent underlying profitability and lower catastrophe losses. Returns were also\\nexcellent with an adjusted return on equity of 16.9%.\\nIf you turn to Slide 4 Allstate delivered in all 5 2019 operating priorities which focused on both near-\\nterm performance and long-term value creation. The first 3 priorities better serve customers grow our\\ncustomer base and achieve target returns on capital they\\'re all intertwined in it just to ensure profitable\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 4\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020\\nlong-term growth. Customers were better served as the enterprise net promotions were improved at most\\nof our businesses.\\nTotal policies in force reached $145.9 million which is an increase of 20.7% (sic) [ 27.7% ] compared\\nto the prior year. Property-Liability policies which are bigger dollar amounts increased by $428000 for\\nthe prior year to $33.7 million as Allstate Esurance brands grew 1.3% and 2.3% respectively. Allstate\\nprotection plans which of course was formerly SquareTrade continued its rapid growth due to the\\naddition of a major retail partner with items in force reaching $99.6 million.\\nReturns remained excellent driven primarily by strong Property-Liability results. The underlying combined\\nratio of 85.0 finished 2019 at the favorable end of our revised full year guidance of 84 to 86 -- 84.5 to\\n86.5.\\nAnd you\\'ll remember as part of our second quarter earnings release last year we had improved this\\nannual outlook range due to excellent operating results.\\nNow as you know Allstate is no longer going to provide underlying combined ratio guidance since return\\non equity is a better measure of performance and Mario is going to provide some additional context on\\nthis measure.\\nThe $88 billion investment portfolio generated $3.2 billion of net investment income in 2019 which\\nreflects higher market-based portfolio yields which was offset by lower performance-based results.\\nPerformance-based results were below expectations for the quarter but longer-term results have been\\nstrong.\\nTotal portfolio return was 9.2% in 2019. Shareholder value has also been created by building long-term\\ngrowth platforms. We announced new features of a transformative growth plan which we\\'ll discuss next.\\nArity continued to expand capabilities. Allstate Identity Protection is growing and launched its new digital\\nfootprint offerings and Avail a car-sharing platform initiated operations.\\nWe move to Slide 5. Let\\'s discuss the transformative growth plan to increase Property-Liability market\\nshare. The plan builds on our strengths and reflects current competitive conditions. Allstate has a\\nsignificant number of competitive strengths as you know particularly in Property-Liability we have\\nthe Allstate brand we have pricing sophistication and claim expertise product breadth and a broad\\ndistribution platform that goes from Allstate agents to Esurance\\'s drug capabilities to Encompass\\'s\\nindependent agents.\\nAs a result we\\'re growing but GEICO and Progressive are growing auto insurance market share faster\\nthrough massive advertising spending and low-cost structures.\\nOur plan also recognizes that customer needs are changing due to increased connectivity and advanced\\nanalytics. Our leading positions in -- at telematics and digital auto collision estimates are 2 examples of\\nhow we\\'re embracing these changes.\\nAt the same time a majority of customers prefer an Allstate -- an insurance agent we hope an Allstate\\ninsurance agent when purchasing a policy but are comfortable with self-service. So we\\'re increasing\\nmobile application capabilities and building low cost centralized integrated service capabilities. We\\'re now\\naccelerating these efforts with the transformative growth plan which has 3 components: expand customer\\naccess; improving the customer value proposition by lowering expenses and redesigning Property-Liability\\nproducts; and investing in technology and marketing.\\nExpanded customer access will be provided by utilizing Esurance\\'s direct capabilities to sell Allstate-\\nbranded products. Esurance has strong direct capabilities having more than doubled in size since it was\\nacquired a little over 8 years ago.\\nAs a result we can further leverage these capabilities by selling Allstate-branded policies directly to\\nconsumers. This will require us to reposition the Allstate brand and the advertising previously deployed for\\nthe Esurance brand will be shifted to the Allstate brand and then the Esurance brand will be phased out in\\nlate 2020.\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 5\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020\\nExpense reductions will improve affordability while funding investments in technology and marketing.\\nWe will also strengthen the independent agent platform by merging the Allstate independent agent\\noffering into Encompass. This is a comprehensive plan that will make us a stronger competitor and lead\\nto increased market share. Now let me turn it over to Mario to go through the Property-Liability and\\ninvestment results.\\nMario Rizzo\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nThanks Tom. Let\\'s go to Slide 6 where we highlight strong results within our Property-Liability segment.\\nPolicy and premium growth continued and all of the brands had strong underlying profitability.\\nUnderwriting income of $1 billion in the fourth quarter was significantly higher than the prior year driven\\nby lower catastrophe losses and the continued improvement in the expense ratio despite increased\\nmarketing investments and the write-off of the remaining Esurance acquisition intangible related to the\\nbrand name.\\nMoving to the table. Net written premium increased 4.4% in the fourth quarter and 5.6% for the full year\\ndriven by policy and average premium growth in Allstate Brand Auto and homeowners insurance and the\\nEsurance brand.\\nTotal policies in force increased 1.3% to $33.7 million in 2019. Underwriting income of $1 billion in the\\nfourth quarter and $2.8 billion for the full year were substantially higher than their respective prior year\\nperiods driven by continued progress on improving our cost structure average premium increases and\\nlower catastrophe losses.\\nThe underlying combined ratio shown in the bottom left which excludes catastrophes prior year reserve\\nreestimates and the $51 million pretax impairment charge related to our decision to utilize the Allstate\\nbrand for direct sales was 84.9 for the fourth quarter.\\nThe 2019 result of 85.0 was at the favorable end of the full year guidance range of 84.5 to 86.5.\\nFocusing on the table on the bottom right of the page you can see our recorded combined ratio trend over\\ntime by line of business as well as total Property-Liability. Auto insurance profitability remains strong with\\na combined ratio of 92.8 excluding the Esurance impairment. Increased average earned premium and\\nlower property damage and bodily injury frequency offset higher severity in 2019.\\nProperty damage severity continues to be impacted by higher cost to repair vehicles while increase\\n-- which increases the number of total losses. Bodily injury severity increased at a rate above medical\\ninflation indices. But we factored these severity trends into our pricing algorithms.\\nHomeowners insurance continues to generate excellent returns. Lower catastrophe losses were significant\\nin achieving a combined ratio of 88.4 for the year. In total Allstate has industry-leading combined ratios\\nfor our Property-Liability businesses.\\nLet\\'s go to Slide 7 which highlights investment performance for the year and the fourth quarter. Our\\ninvestment portfolio total return for 2019 was 9.2%. Net investment income contributed 3.7% to\\ntotal return with a stable contribution from interest income on fixed-income investments but a lower\\ncontribution from our performance-based portfolio. Higher bond and equity valuation contributed 5.5% to\\ntotal return in 2019.\\nThe chart at the bottom shows net investment income for the fourth quarter of $689 million $97 million\\nlower than the fourth quarter of 2018.\\nMarket-based investment income shown in blue increased to $735 million and benefited from proactive\\nactions we\\'ve taken including a duration extension in our Property-Liability portfolio. Performance-based\\nincome shown in gray was lower than recent trend and included lower valuations of $74 million pretax on\\n2 private equity limited partnerships.\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 6\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020\\nGiven the performance-based portfolio\\'s impact on reported income let\\'s turn to Slide 8 to review the\\npurpose makeup and results of these investments. Our performance-based strategy delivers attractive\\nlong-term risk-adjusted returns and is well suited for long-dated liabilities and capital.\\nThe strategy diversifies our portfolio through idiosyncratic equity returns that complement our market-\\nbased strategy. The portfolio is broadly diversified by asset type including private equity and real estate\\nas well as geography sectors and partners.\\nWe invest in funds co-invest and have direct investments as well. The $8.7 billion portfolio had a 1-\\nyear return through September of 7.6% and 3- and 5-year returns of around 11%. While idiosyncratic\\ninvestments generate higher returns they do create income volatility as you can see on the right. The\\nportfolio generated $469 million of investment income in 2019 but all of that occurred in the first 3\\nquarters.\\nIn 2018 the portfolio generated $716 million of investment income and $145 million in the fourth quarter.\\nWe continuously monitor the portfolio and do not believe the lower valuations on 2 private equity\\ninvestments in the fourth quarter are indicative of the broader portfolio.\\nSlide 9 highlights results for Allstate Life Benefits and Annuities. Allstate Life shown on the left\\ngenerated adjusted net income of $76 million in the fourth quarter and $261 million for the year. The\\nfourth quarter improved by $7 million compared to the prior year quarter driven by higher net investment\\nincome and lower operating costs. The full year income of $261 million was 11.5% below 2018 due to the\\nthird quarter write-down of deferred acquisition costs in connection with the annual actuarial assumption\\nreview which reflected lower interest rates.\\nAllstate Benefits adjusted net income of $16 million in the fourth quarter was $10 million below the\\nprior year quarter. This decline was primarily driven by the write-off of acquisition costs related to the\\nnonrenewal of a large underperforming account.\\nFor the full year adjusted net income of $115 million was $9 million below the prior year. Allstate\\nAnnuities shown on the bottom right had an adjusted net loss of $33 million in the fourth quarter driven\\nby lower performance-based income. Adjusted net income of $10 million for the full year 2019 was below\\nthe prior year reflecting lower performance-based investment income in the first and fourth quarters.\\nLet\\'s turn to Slide 10. The Service Businesses continued to grow the number of customers protected with\\npolicies in force increasing 42% to $105.9 million. This is largely due to the increase in Allstate Protection\\nPlans.\\nRevenues grew 21.9% to $434 million in the fourth quarter reaching $1.6 billion for the full year 2019.\\nAdjusted net income was $3 million in the fourth quarter and $38 million for the full year. Adjusted net\\nincome increased in 2019 compared to the prior year period as improved loss performance in Allstate\\nProtection Plans and Allstate Dealer Services were partially offset by continued growth and integration\\ninvestments at Allstate Identity Protection.\\nSlide 11 highlights the excellent cash returns provided to shareholders. In 2019 we returned $2.5 billion\\nto common shareholders through a combination of $1.8 billion in share repurchases and $653 million in\\ncommon stock dividends. We repurchased 16.4 million or 4.9% of common shares outstanding over the\\nlast 12 months and increased our book value per share by more than $15 to $73.12.\\nThe $3 billion share repurchase program announced in October 2018 was completed in late January 2020.\\nAnd yesterday the Board approved a new $3 billion share repurchase authorization to be completed by\\nthe end of 2021. We also reduced the cost of capital in 2019 by redeeming multiple series of preferred\\nstock and issued 2 new series at lower rates which will reduce preferred dividends by $17 million\\nannually.\\nLet\\'s move to Slide 12 and discuss our long-term return on equity goal. Starting this year we will no\\nlonger provide annual Property-Liability underlying combined ratio guidance but instead discuss returns\\non equity.\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 7\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020\\nAs we\\'ve discussed over the past 2 quarters this is a better measure of our performance for multiple\\nreasons. It is a broader long-term measure of performance than the underlying combined ratio which\\nfocuses on just one part of one of our businesses and excludes significant items such as investment\\nincome catastrophes and other protection businesses income.\\nIt factors in capital management and is more correlated with stock price and it fosters a better\\ncomparison with our peers.\\nOn a long-term basis our adjusted net income return on equity goal is 14% to 17%. This range also\\naligns with executive compensation as discussed in our annual proxy statement.\\nNow we\\'ll open up the line for questions.\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 8\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020\\nQuestion and Answer\\nOperator\\n[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo.\\nElyse Beth Greenspan\\nWells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division\\nYes I\\'m sorry. Can you guys hear me?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nYes.\\nMario Rizzo\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nWe can yes.\\nOperator\\nYes.\\nElyse Beth Greenspan\\nWells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division\\nSo my first question is on your ROE target the 14% to 17%. Just a couple of questions there. If we\\ncan get a sense of what you define as the long term? And then how you see kind of 2020 coming in in\\nreference to that 14% to 17%? And then my last question on that front would be are you going to go in\\nany particular details on the returns that you\\'re targeting within that -- within Property-Liability versus\\nyour Life-related businesses or services?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nElyse thanks for the question. First -- let me deal with the second question first. We\\'re not going to give\\nout a number for 2020 which goes to your first question which is we kind of look at this kind of like a\\nrolling 3-year basis is like over a 3- year period caps go up and down things go up and down and we\\nshould be able to earn a 14% to 17% return. We got there by really looking at a couple of things. First is\\nwhat\\'s a level of economic rent we can capture by how good we are in the market we operate in. And so\\nas you know in the Property-Liability business we run a substantially more favorable combined ratio than\\nthe industry and that\\'s worth a substantial amount of economic return. We also look at it from what\\'s the\\nappropriate risks -- what\\'s the appropriate return for the risks that our shareholders take. And we feel like\\n14% to 17% is a good goal for us to have over that 3-year basis.\\nWe don\\'t -- I don\\'t think you should try to use this to decide what 2020 forecasts are. There\\'s a lot of\\nbetter ways to do a forecast. We\\'re not going to break it out by component because our goal here was to\\nget up to the corporate level and say what are we doing in total because with the underlying combined\\nratio we basically zoomed ourselves in including you all into how well was auto insurance doing that\\nwe\\'ve neglected to focus on the other opportunities to do.\\nObviously the 14% to 17% includes a whole bunch of components. So the Annuities as we\\'ve talked\\nabout before are a large drag on that. So if you were to intuit between the 300-plus percent drag that\\nhas on ROE to the other businesses you would say the other businesses are higher return. And of course\\nmost of that is Property-Liability. But that will change over time obviously. The acquisitions like the\\npurchase of Allstate Protection Plans obviously we -- that business is doing extremely well from our\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 9\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020\\nstandpoint is well above its acquisition targets but it does put a drag on ROE. Interest rates would go the\\nother way particularly in the Property-Liability portfolio.\\nSo what we did was stand back and say what do we think is right over time on kind of a rolling 3-year\\nbasis.\\nElyse Beth Greenspan\\nWells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division\\nOkay that\\'s helpful. And then my second question you guys rolled out your new growth-related\\noptimization efforts in December. Just want to get a sense as you kind of change your commission\\nstructure a little bit how you envision that playing out in terms of both a pickup in new business growth?\\nAnd any kind of drag you see that having on the underlying loss ratio I guess specifically to your auto\\nbook?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nWell let me maybe go up for a minute and ask Glenn to talk about the commission changes you\\'re talking\\nabout for 2020 which I think the specific one you\\'re referring. So transformative growth is a multiyear\\neffort. We expect -- it has both expanding customer access improving customer value and investing in\\ntechnology and marketing to help us grow market share. The improving value will be done 2 ways: one\\nreducing expenses and that\\'s expenses across the board and we can talk more about that later if you\\nwant but that\\'s really across the board; and redesign the Property-Liability products.\\nGlenn did make some changes to the commission structure for 2020 which he can talk about.\\nGlenn Thomas Shapiro\\nPresident of Personal Property-Liability & Director\\nYes. Thanks. Elyse we\\'ve got a few things going to stimulate growth in what is a very competitive\\nenvironment right now. So we\\'re pleased that we\\'re able to keep growing. And to the second part of\\nyour question deliver returns. So I\\'ll answer that part first. Do we expect it to as we grow to deteriorate\\nreturns. I would say no because we\\'ve evidenced that we\\'re pretty disciplined about that. And we\\'ve been\\n-- as we\\'ve grown we\\'ve kept our eye on the returns. But the specific actions: one are -- you referred to\\nthe change in compensation. We moved some of the compensation variable comp from agents renewals\\nto new business to incentivize growth. We want to pay folks for growing their business. We\\'re also putting\\nmore into advertising and managing our lead management platform.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James.\\nCharles Gregory Peters\\nRaymond James & Associates Inc. Research Division\\nMy first question will be around the expense ratio improvement that you guys generated in 2019. I think\\nthat\\'s probably the biggest surprise at least from an outside observer perspective. In some of your\\nprevious comments you said there was some benefit for incentive comp. So I guess my question is\\naround how much of that 90 basis points was sustainable considering the strong results that you posted\\nlast year? Is that going to boost up the incentive comp for 2020? And then dovetail the expense ratio\\nimprovement with what\\'s -- what kind of anticipation or expectation should we have about continuing\\nimprovements? So should we factor in some modest improvement every year? I know you guys are rolling\\nout the integrated services platform et cetera?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nGreg let me take incentive comp Mario can talk about expenses. So we set incentive comp targets every\\nyear. So -- and so we have 2 measures: one is -- or 2 programs: one is the annual incentive plan which\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 10\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020\\nis management\\'s compensation program. And that\\'s set every year based on how well we did the year\\nbefore. So it\\'s not like you get a couple of years. We also have obviously a longer-term plan which is our\\nperformance stock awards which are tied to return on equity.\\nSo those -- you shouldn\\'t expect fall over from 1 year to another as it relates to expenses. If we exceed\\nthe targets established by the Board then obviously we have to put that into the P&L. But presumably\\nthat\\'s because we\\'re making more money than everybody thought.\\nMario Rizzo\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes Greg thanks for the question. It\\'s Mario. I just would add a couple of things. So first I think we\\'re --\\ncontinue to be pleased with the progress we\\'re making on expenses. And as Tom talked about earlier it\\'s\\na core part of our transformative growth strategy and one of the ways that we\\'re going to further improve\\nthe customer value proposition and create the capacity for the growth investments that he alluded to. So\\nour work in this area is not done. We\\'re going to keep focusing on expenses and look to drive down the\\nexpense ratio. One thing I\\'ll add with the fourth quarter specifically the impairment charge related to the\\nEsurance brand was worth about 0.6 point on the expense ratio. So if you look year-over-year you see\\nsome real meaningful improvement in the expense ratio in the quarter. That gets a little bit masked by\\nthat nonrecurring charge.\\nCharles Gregory Peters\\nRaymond James & Associates Inc. Research Division\\nIs that -- Mario is that where the Esurance expense ratio is? I think was up 27.5% in the fourth quarter.\\nIs that what you\\'re talking about?\\nMario Rizzo\\nExecutive VP & CFO\\nYes it\\'s in the expense ratio. It\\'s worth about 0.6 for the overall Property-Liability number obviously more\\nof an impact to Esurance specifically.\\nCharles Gregory Peters\\nRaymond James & Associates Inc. Research Division\\nGot it. Great. The second question I guess let\\'s pivot to the performance-based investments. Obviously\\nit\\'s generated a strong result for you over a long period of time but there\\'s volatility. And this past year\\nthere was volatility. And for outside observers can you provide any guidance for us on how we should\\nthink about that volatility as we think about 2020 -- the 2020 outlook?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nSo -- Greg. Thanks. Let me make an overall comment about investments and John can go through\\nthe -- more color on performance-based recognizing we don\\'t like to give next year\\'s projections out\\nthere. We proactively manage our portfolio. John\\'s created and uses a really comprehensive capital\\nallocation framework that helps the investment team decide what and when to invest. And it keeps track\\nof the decisions we made not just the investments we made but -- so we can track those. But also any\\nopportunities missed or any losses we avoided. So we watch our money well and that\\'s on all parts of\\nthe portfolio. So John can talk about what we do how we deploy that in performance-based and what it\\nmeans.\\nUnknown Executive\\nYes. Thanks for the question Greg. When you go up and think about the whole portfolio it helps put\\nperformance-based in context and why we like it. The portfolio is about $88 billion in size. It\\'s -- majority\\nof it\\'s invested in high quality fixed income instruments and then about 18% of that is equity and\\nroughly half of that is performance-based. So just to kind of size it within the overall context. We like\\nperformance-based because it focuses on private markets and really expands our opportunity set of\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 11\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020\\ninvestments that we can play with. It allows us to create in our belief a more efficient frontier a more\\nefficient portfolio that\\'s well suited to our overall liability and capital structure. What comes with that is\\nincreased volatility on income. And we believe that -- and we will -- we expect volatility. We\\'ll expect it\\nin the past and we\\'ll expect it going forward. We believe that we\\'re compensated for that volatility of\\nincome.\\nIn this particular quarter that volatility especially if you look at it year-over-year on a quarterly basis\\nthe difference was $97 million. About $74 million of that was tied to 2 investments. That obviously\\nwas a disappointment but we\\'ve gone back in and we recognize that when you look at the underlying\\ninvestments here they range from timber and agriculture to real estate to private equity to a number of\\ndifferent investments in there. It\\'s hard to pin down with great precision in any given quarter how that\\'s\\ngoing to play out. So I would expect continued volatility. But we have also gone through in as part of our\\nregular risk and surveillance processes looked at all of our holdings as we normally would do and believe\\nthat this was not a -- this was a bit of a one-off type of quarter.\\nWe remain confident in the effort going forward. Despite this -- the performance in this quarter we believe\\nwe have a strong team. I -- when we look at measuring this we really look to longer-term measures. We\\nlook to 3 5 and 10 year and some of those measures are in the investor supplement. And those tend to\\nbe holding true. So we really aren\\'t changing our overall commitment to it. And expect while there may\\nbe bumps in the road in any given quarter that long run it\\'s an important part of what we do.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler.\\nJon Paul Newsome\\nPiper Sandler & Co. Research Division\\nI was hoping you could just give us a little bit of an update as how you see the current pricing and\\ncompetitive trend in auto. Obviously last year was a pretty competitive year. But if you think that things\\nare stabilizing industry-wide or not? Love to hear your thoughts.\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nPaul this is Tom. Let me make a couple of overall thematic conversations and then Glenn can talk about\\nwhat he\\'s seeing in the market by a competitor. But our philosophy has been to -- for -- as you know\\nprofitable growth and long-term profitable growth. So we raise prices when we think we need to or when\\nthe trends show we should do it. And so we don\\'t get behind on it. We\\'re not big in terms of reducing price\\nto try to grow like we -- I like to say around here anybody can lose their way to increase market share\\nand that\\'s not our plan. The other thing I would say is you always have to be careful of the percentages\\nbecause it always depends where you start. So we have some competitors who are higher price than us.\\nAnd they\\'re reducing their prices. And other carriers who are lower than us on certain risks and they\\'re\\nraising the prices. So Glenn can talk about the percentages and there are obviously some overall macro\\ntrends at work in auto insurance pricing. But I just -- we have to be careful not to be too specific as to\\nwhat it means for next quarter sales.\\nGlenn Thomas Shapiro\\nPresident of Personal Property-Liability & Director\\nYes. Thanks. And as Tom said I think it -- I\\'ll lead you to one set of numbers that I think tells the story.\\nOur average premium in auto was up 3% year-over-year and our average loss and expense was up 2.5%.\\nSo we were disciplined in managing to a positive return and actually made a little progress during a time\\nwhere as you said it was very very competitive out there. We did see some competitors take sort of\\nbroad-based rate reductions which is why the overall CPI is negative that as Tom said not a trend we\\'ll\\nfollow or something we subscribe to. We look state-by-state. To your question about what we\\'re seeing\\nmore recently is it stabilizing I would say I\\'ll give you a qualified yes. There is a little bit more rate\\nactivity starting to flow into the market. You\\'re seeing less price reductions or really no price reductions in\\nthe recent past. And you see some increases out there. So I\\'d call it more stable.\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 12\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020\\nJon Paul Newsome\\nPiper Sandler & Co. Research Division\\nFantastic. Second question obviously on the commercial line side of the world there\\'s a lot of\\nconversation about basically casualty-related inflation trends. I recognize that that\\'s not a huge part of\\nwhat you do as an auto and home insurer. But can you talk to whether or not you\\'re seeing any of that in\\nthe fairly modest pieces that are casualty parts of your business?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nPaul are you talking about bodily injury costs? Is that where you\\'re zooming in?\\nJon Paul Newsome\\nPiper Sandler & Co. Research Division\\nWell actually I\\'m thinking more of pure liability in the home insurance business for example. Slips and\\nfalls and lawsuits and things of that nature.\\nGlenn Thomas Shapiro\\nPresident of Personal Property-Liability & Director\\nYes. So not seeing much of a trend on the home side on that. Our trends that are more meaningful for us\\non the home side really are the mix between frequency and severity of our property -- first-party losses.\\nSo we\\'re not seeing really anything on home.\\nOperator\\nYour next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs.\\nYaron Joseph Kinar\\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. Research Division\\nFirst question is around net premiums written growth. I think it\\'s slowed down a little bit. And I guess in\\nparticular you see a little bit of a slowdown in renewal ratios and then new applications especially in auto.\\nCan you maybe talk about that and maybe how that ties to the transformative growth plan?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nSure. We can. First as I said earlier it\\'s all about profitable growth for us. The transformative growth plan\\nshould bring our expense ratio down and enable us to improve our competitive position which should\\ndrive to higher growth. In 2019 throughout the year there was different stories in the Allstate-branded\\nbusiness than the Esurance business. So Glenn maybe you can talk about the Allstate-branded business\\nand Esurance for 2019 was still under Steve. It\\'s now of course under Glenn as part of our transformative\\ngrowth. But Steve maybe you can pop in on Esurance.\\nGlenn Thomas Shapiro\\nPresident of Personal Property-Liability & Director\\nSo yes I\\'ll start us off. And just at a high level I\\'ll tell you we feel good about the fact that we\\'re able to\\ngrow in a really competitive market. It\\'s been pointed out before on the call here negative CPI premium\\'s\\nup 5.5% policies in force grew across all major lines. And it\\'s hard work to do that in a competitive\\nenvironment. So it\\'s challenging. To your point that moved down a little bit in the fourth quarter but\\nwe\\'re still in the upper bounds in that sort of call it the upper 1/3 of our long-term trend on both\\nretention and new business. We\\'re coming off of a high base year. And we\\'re taking the actions short term\\nas we build out transformative growth taking the actions short term to grow which I referenced before of\\nchanging agency comp where we\\'re shifting more towards new business putting more into marketing.\\nSteven Emil Shebik\\nVice Chairman\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 13\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020\\nSo for 2019 Esurance had about 8.5% increase in net written premium. So for the year it feels good\\nbut that trend declined throughout the year. In the fourth quarter it was only about 2.6%. And what we\\ndid as you know we grew fairly rapidly last year also. And so we had that new business penalty. And\\nin some states we took some fairly significant rates more in the second half of the year. So that really\\nslowed down our growth and -- as we go into the third and fourth quarter. Overall we felt good about the\\ngrowth we had. We feel good where the business is positioned going forward. But we have to [ use growth\\nprofitably ].\\nYaron Joseph Kinar\\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. Research Division\\nOkay. That\\'s helpful. And then my second question just goes back to the ROE guidance range for the\\nnext 3 years. It\\'s -- I guess what would be the largest components that would drive ROE to the upper\\nend of that range or the lower end of that range? And does that range also contemplate the possibility of\\ndisposition of the Annuities business?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nYaron obviously there\\'s a number of components here. There\\'s -- what\\'s your -- the obvious piece is\\nwhat\\'s your combined ratio and underwriting income. That\\'s impacted by what your underlying is also\\nwhat catastrophes are which as you know bounce around.\\nThere\\'s what happens to investment income and we\\'ve talked about that at length today. There\\'s also\\nthe amount of equity you have at play. And so as we\\'re -- we\\'ve been building equity but we\\'re still\\nbuying shares back. So that has an impact. As it relates to the future this is kind of an as-is business\\nmodel approach. We didn\\'t assume anything was going to change. And as I mentioned to Elyse is that\\nthings will change in the future right? But we still feel like 14% to 17% is the right range. But lots of stuff\\ncould change right? The interest rates could go up. And if interest rates go up for the Property-Liability\\nbusiness most of that income falls right through to the bottom line. And if you look at our investment\\nincome over a long period of time we are down substantially. Now we\\'ve made that up by reducing\\nthe combined ratio and improving underwriting income but that will change over time. Obviously the\\nAnnuities business would be a positive. To the extent we decided to invest in growth in an acquisition that\\nwould be a negative.\\nSo we felt like in total the 14% to 17% was a good goal for our -- goal for us. But if it changes as the\\nworld changes then we\\'ll let people know. But it\\'s a 3-year kind of rolling average for us.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI.\\nDavid Kenneth Motemaden\\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities Research Division\\nJust a follow-up on the transformative growth plan. And just trying to get some sense for when you think\\nwe should start to see the benefits of those changes start to roll through in terms of more competitive\\nproduct and then an uptick in new applications better retention and higher PIF growth after we\\'ve seen a\\nbit of a deceleration in all of those metrics?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nYes. David first it\\'s a long-term plan. This is going to take us multiple years to do. But there\\'s obviously\\ncomponents of it and some parts will have a bigger impact early and other parts will have a larger impact\\nlater in the game. So we expect early in the plan that expense reductions will play a significant role\\nin us improving our affordability for customers and getting to that second part of improving the value\\nproposition. As you go forward we would expect that redesigning our Property-Liability products will drive\\nmore differentiation. So we were first to market with declining deductibles first to market with new car\\nreplacement. There are other ideas and things we have in place that we think can drive more value. But\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 14\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020\\nit\\'s going to take more time to put those into the marketplace. So those -- so in terms of improving the\\ncustomer value proposition expenses first redesign products later. The reason redesign products is later\\nis in part it requires a new technology platform which is the third piece. We have to invest more in a\\nnew technology platform particularly our product management platform and our customer experience\\nlayer.\\nSo that will take us a while to do. We think we can still cut expenses and reduce the overall expense\\nload while we are investing in those and that\\'s our goal. But at the same time we\\'re going to invest\\nmore in marketing earlier in the process because we believe that will drive growth. I think Glenn talked\\nabout what he is doing to enhance the Allstate agent value proposition whether that\\'s increasing new\\nbusiness commissions or freeing them up by taking low value work out of their offices and putting it into\\nintegrated service. The other piece is to expand the access and that\\'s happening as we speak. So the\\naccess to people who called for the Allstate brand or got on to our website and the Allstate brand had\\nsome restricted rules on it which we started to open those up now. So for example if you called during\\nworking hours you could get a different experience than if you called after working hours -- like you\\nshould have the same experience. Like you\\'re getting online it shouldn\\'t matter what time of day you do\\nthat. So we\\'re changing those rules.\\nNow what Glenn is also doing is taking the Esurance capabilities which are exceptionally good in direct.\\nHe\\'s putting those together with the Allstate-branded capabilities which do some direct today. And that\\nwill then be utilized for the Allstate brand. That will take us some time to do. One obviously he\\'s got to\\nput all the operations together and call centers and get the technology to work the same and get to order\\n-- the flow on the website all to be the same.\\nWe also need to reposition the Allstate brand. And so the Allstate brand of course is extremely well-\\nknown great unaided awareness high trust marks. People -- it\\'s one of the great brands of the world. And\\nthat said it\\'s not viewed as modern as Esurance is. So Esurance is built for the modern world a little hip\\na little cleaner. So we are working hard on repositioning the Allstate brand so that it brings both of those\\ntogether so that we both serve our customers with agents when they want them and we serve them\\ndirect when they want. So it\\'s a long-term plan but you can see there\\'s -- it\\'s front-end loaded on some\\nparts and back-end loaded on others.\\nDavid Kenneth Motemaden\\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities Research Division\\nGot it. And just with the customer value proposition and some of the increases in the bodily injury severity\\nthat popped above CPI medical CPI this quarter which is the first time I think in a bit it has. Have you\\n-- I mean is that already embedded in your pricing? Or is that something that would I guess go the other\\nway against some of these expense saves that may be able to pass through a more competitive rate?\\nGlenn Thomas Shapiro\\nPresident of Personal Property-Liability & Director\\nYes. I\\'ll take that. This is Glenn. And yes we\\'ve seen some of the trends come through that you\\'ve heard\\nabout from others on bodily injury. It is embedded in our reserve position that we have. We\\'re -- we think\\nthrough these things as we set our reserves as we set our pricing strategy. As you\\'ve seen over the last\\ncouple of years where we\\'ve run hot on physical damage severity and yet it really hasn\\'t flowed through\\nto the margins because we\\'re pretty quick at adapting from a pricing standpoint and on a market-by-\\nmarket basis. So I would tell you we\\'re watching it. We\\'ve got good process. We have a great claims\\ndepartment that looks at both the technology and the process that they follow to handle claims. And\\nwhere it goes beyond what claims can manage when they\\'re paying claims accurately we get it into\\npricing quickly.\\nDavid Kenneth Motemaden\\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities Research Division\\nOkay great. And then if I could just sneak one last one in. Just in terms of the high-end of the ROE guide.\\nAnd I guess just thinking about potentially like there have been a few transactions in the fourth quarter\\non the Life side and it seems like there\\'s a pretty vibrant interest for -- a lot of interest in some of these\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 15\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020\\nrunoff books of Annuities or Life insurance. Just wondering -- in Illinois I believe there\\'s a division of\\ncompany rule that can allow you to carve out specific reserves out of that Illinois legal entity and divest\\nto a potential acquirer. So just sort of wanted to get an update on your view in terms of your thinking\\nin terms of like whether you see any opportunities there to potentially reinsure or divest that book. And\\nmaybe get to a more sustainable high-end of that ROE guide given it has like a 300 bp drag on the ROE.\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nWell it is a third question. But this is different than the other ones. I will take it. But I also -- let\\'s try to --\\nthere are other people in the house.\\nDavid Kenneth Motemaden\\nEvercore ISI Institutional Equities Research Division\\nYes. I apologize.\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nThe answer is we\\'ve been trying to -- we\\'ve been working on Annuities for a whole bunch of years trying\\nto get it better. We made a lot of progress to the extent there\\'s something else we can do whether it\\'s use\\na division statute to get a different solution reinsure it. If we can do it in a way that is economic for our\\nshareholders and has a good risk-adjusted return we\\'ll do that. And if we do that I don\\'t think anybody\\nwould be unhappy if we were -- if you looked at -- if we were above the upper end of the guidance.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research.\\nAmit Kumar\\nThe Buckingham Research Group Incorporated\\nTwo quick follow-up questions. The first I guess is in response to the previous question on the shift in\\nthe plan -- the new plan. Can you give us any early sort of feedback from agents: number one on the\\nintegrated services platform; and number two also what are the feedback on shifting the bonus and the\\ncommission structure from existing and new businesses?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nLet me -- Amit I think we got it. We were all leaning in towards the speaker to make sure we heard you\\nit was a little light. So I think Glenn can talk about integrated service and the commissions. Maybe let me\\ngo back to transformative growth and make a comment really on behalf of the customer. So the agents\\nare part of our team we want them to be successful we\\'re leaning in hard to make them successful. They\\ndrive a bunch of our business and we\\'re going to work hard at making them successful. That said there\\'s\\na range of opinions as to what people think about what you\\'re doing.\\nBut let me come back to the customer. What we are trying to do with transformative growth is stick with\\nour customer philosophies. And our -- one of our philosophies is you should pay a fair price for the risk\\nyou create. We\\'re very sophisticated in the way we do pricing. We have telematics which is the new end\\nof it with Drivewise. We also have a philosophy that customers should get what they pay for. As it relates\\nto the auto insurance so the same things apply. So if you get extra service then you should -- and extra\\nadvice from a help of an agent that should be something you should be prepared to pay extra for. If you\\nwant to do all stuff yourself and that\\'s something that\\'s a different price/value proposition.\\nSo we are working hard to make sure that that agent value proposition is as effective and efficient as it\\ncan be. Like people as we said I think we said when we talked about this that over half the people want\\nan agent and it\\'s higher as it reflects our customer base. So we want to help them be as successful as\\nthey can and that\\'s why Glenn is working on a couple of programs he is.\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 16\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020\\nGlenn Thomas Shapiro\\nPresident of Personal Property-Liability & Director\\nYes I\\'ll just add to it. We talk to our agency force all the time talking to agents every week. We\\'ve got\\nnational advisory council regional Boards. We spend a lot of time with our agency force. And I\\'ll give you\\nthe range of reactions. So on the overall the big thing out of transformative growth the -- we\\'re going\\nto pull the marketing in from Esurance at the Allstate brand as you might imagine wildly popular. Like\\neverybody feels really good about the fact that there\\'s going to be more marketing in the pipeline and\\nwe\\'re focusing on the Allstate brand.\\nOn the commission change. You\\'ve got folks that they were growing fast and they\\'re built to grow. They\\nlike it a lot because it leans right into their strength. You\\'ve got folks that really weren\\'t growing or weren\\'t\\nbuilt to grow. You have a range of folks who either excited about making that transition and retooling their\\nbusiness or ones that say I wasn\\'t really ready to retool my business. And -- but they need to in order to\\nearn the commission that goes with the new business the higher new business commission. As it goes to\\nintegrated service as Tom said lots of different opinions out there it really is about bringing people up for\\ngrowth. And what I can tell you is the folks that are in it are growing faster than the folks that aren\\'t. So\\nwe think we\\'re creating something that\\'s going to be really valuable for the agency force.\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nSo the -- if you go back to the customer and what blends higher new business. When you ask customers\\nwhere does an agent add the most value. It\\'s almost always on either the purchase of the product or\\ndoing an insurance review. Helping me sort out stuff.\\nVery little of it is on changing address. And so that\\'s what Glenn\\'s working on.\\nAmit Kumar\\nThe Buckingham Research Group Incorporated\\nThat\\'s a fair comment. And very quickly on the loss cost trend. I know you briefly talked about it. But net-\\nnet can you talk about -- when you look at the frequency and severity trends is the expectation that this\\nis how it sort of remains for the foreseeable future? Or what\\'s your outlook on the loss cost trends here?\\nGlenn Thomas Shapiro\\nPresident of Personal Property-Liability & Director\\nSo I\\'ll take that. This is Glenn. I\\'d like to -- let me go up a little bit because I think if you look at the whole\\nsystem and you say there\\'s the premiums that come in and how we make changes to those over time it\\'s\\nthe expenses that are going out the door and then you split your loss cost by frequency and severity.\\nOver the past year 3 out of those 4 have been going well for us.\\nWe -- our premium as you mentioned auto is up 3% average premium. Home is up 5% average\\npremium. The respective loss and expense on those lines are 2.5 and 4.\\nSo we\\'ve made up 0.5 point and 1 point in terms of actually improving over the time period. So it\\'s hard\\nfor me to say I can\\'t predict that severity will be flattening or up more over a year or 2 years from now.\\nBut what I can tell you is we\\'ve been really disciplined about managing it quickly into each market on a\\nmarket-by-market basis. Our pricing sophistication our state management team has gotten better and\\nbetter. And we\\'re able to react in real-time to those changes and manage to the types of returns that\\nwe\\'ve been able to deliver. So while I can\\'t give you a perfect prediction on where the severity will go I\\nfeel really good about our ability to react to it in real-time.\\nOperator\\nOur next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research.\\nRyan James Tunis\\nAutonomous Research LLP\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 17\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020\\nA couple for Glenn. So Tom mentioned that over half of Allstate brand customers [one ] in Asia. I thought\\nthat was interesting. In terms of just like the pathway of becoming an Allstate brand customer what\\npercentage of people I guess start on the internet Google insurance or something like that? And is that\\nthe lead generation mechanism I guess just digital or the Internet versus an Allstate agent as a little\\nleague coach or something like that?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nRyan Glenn can get you through some of the percentages we give out. But this is an or conversation. A\\nlot of times people like well they want to buy direct or through an agent. It\\'s an and like we\\'ll sell to\\npeople any way they want. Like if you want to start online buy it from the agent if you want to call an\\nagent buy online like we\\'re just there to -- like we want to sell as much as we can to as many people we\\ncan through as many ways as we can.\\nGlenn Thomas Shapiro\\nPresident of Personal Property-Liability & Director\\nWell it\\'s a challenging question I\\'ll tell you because there\\'s a lot of stops in the process where for\\nexample people go online they start to get a quote. And the agency that\\'s nearest to them pops up with\\nthat quote and they decide to drop off make a phone call and that\\'s one path.\\nThere\\'s multiple paths people take through. The vast majority of our business is written by a local agent.\\nThat said all the data and research out there tells you that the vast majority of people start their process\\nonline at least get some understanding and then want to talk to somebody about it. So we\\'ve got a mix\\nof that and imperfect data for me to give you any more specifics on that.\\nRyan James Tunis\\nAutonomous Research LLP\\nAnd then I was hoping you could give us a bit of a peek on some of these new product initiatives. I\\nguess in particular trying to understand the price sensitivity or whatever. I mean obviously you\\'re a\\ncaptive agent. Are you thinking new business pricing down 10% or something like that? I\\'m just trying to\\nunderstand like how much of a driver do you think that is for potential new issued applications.\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nRyan I\\'m not sure we understood the question. We\\'re not -- maybe you could rephrase it.\\nRyan James Tunis\\nAutonomous Research LLP\\nYes. No. So I\\'ll ask it this way. Like 2 or 3 years ago Travelers who\\'s obviously an independent agent\\nplayer they just announced that they were cutting new business prices by 10%. I could see how that\\ncould have more of an impact in like an agency distribution channel versus a captive. I\\'m wondering if\\nthat\\'s how you see it as well. Or if you think that -- am I missing something? Or is there a similar level of\\nprice elasticity in captive as what you might see in agent like could that be a big driver for growth?\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nOkay. Let me maybe start with the last piece and work my way up and anybody else wants to jump in. So\\nfirst there -- it\\'s of course always hard to tell how much price elasticity there is within an agency.\\nIn general you would think that an agency that had multiple companies and could share those multiple\\nquotes because there would be more price elasticity than in a captive agent.\\nThat said people can call around to 3 or 4 people and get their points of view. So auto insurance in\\nparticular is price sensitive. Although we\\'ve talked at length at us trying to have profitable growth like\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.\\nspglobal.com/marketintelligence 18\\nTHE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020\\nthat\\'s what we\\'re trying to do. The redesign of the products is on all of our products auto home and a\\nvariety of different products where there are things we think we can do to make them less complicated.\\nAnd so for example this year we rewrote the renters policy in one state and took it size down by 40%.\\nThat gets to less complexity helping customers understand it. So we\\'re doing the proper.\\nBut we also have a variety of other products in the circle of protection we\\'re trying to get to. So we don\\'t\\nsell Identity Protection today through our Allstate agents. Makes sense that we have customers who\\ncome to Allstate agents probably would like to get their identity protected. How do we do that? How\\ndo we get the systems to work how do we get the technology platform do it? How does Glenn factor it\\ninto compensation and everything else is something we\\'re working on. And that\\'s part of transformative\\ngrowth on a longer basis.\\nSo we have many products we sell through many channels. But we don\\'t sell all of our products through all\\nof our channels. And that\\'s part of transformative growth is how do we sell more of what we sell already in\\nmore of the places that we sell. Does that get to your -- I think that gets -- okay.\\nOperator\\nOur final question then for today comes from the line of Michael Zaremski from Crédit Suisse.\\nMichael David Zaremski\\nCrédit Suisse AG Research Division\\nFirst question if I -- the P&C investment portfolio the duration has increased fairly measurably over the\\nlast few years up to 5-plus years now. I was just curious do you continue to see that elongating? Or are\\nyou kind of at the high-end of your kind of the range you\\'re comfortable with versus kind of the duration\\nof liabilities?\\nUnknown Executive\\nYes Mike it\\'s John. Thanks for the question. Look you never know exactly what the future holds. So\\nwe\\'re always going to respond to economic conditions overall risk environment of our firm and structure\\nthe portfolio that way. I would say that what we\\'ve seen in terms of the duration extension in recent time.\\nAnd a lot of that\\'s taken place in the last 18 months was more of a reaction back to strategic norm as\\ninterest rates had been rising prior to that with the Fed -- with the cycle that the Fed was in. We thought\\nthat it was prudent to stay a little bit short and looked to recapture higher yields that are better -- when\\nthere\\'s a better opportunity.\\nWe couple that with a little bit. If you go back 18 to 24 months the economic situation in the U.S. and the\\nworld was different. It was softer at that time and it wasn\\'t clear that policymakers were going to engage.\\nThey were in a tightening cycle. We thought that they needed to engage. We also wanted to put a little bit\\nof inflation -- recession protection back in the portfolio when you have more duration. If the economy falls\\noff it tends to help your portfolio and balance it out more. So we did actively highly coordinated internally\\nwith all our risk processes extend the duration. It had a number of benefits that we\\'re pleased with. It did\\nincrease income which is a positive. It also did build in a more balanced portfolio balanced out our risk-\\nbased assets.\\nAnd if you look at -- this isn\\'t perfect math but if you look back at where rates were when we did most\\nof the extension relative to where they are today. It\\'s been a great price increase in our fixed-income\\nsecurities. Rates are roughly market yields when you include where treasuries were and where corporates\\nare roughly about 100 basis points lower than that time. So going forward we\\'ll continue to monitor.\\nWhat I can assure you is that it will be highly coordinated inside. Tom talked earlier about our numerous\\nprocesses. Our capital allocation process with investments. We also work very closely with our enterprise\\nrisk group to make sure that these are -- all our moves are well understood.\\nAnd we will -- we believe that proactive management investment portfolio is a way to add value to the\\nenterprise.\\nMichael David Zaremski\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc.

Yes definitely it\\'s been a great call. Lastly clearly a lot of questions about the new\\ncommission structure. Maybe curious has policy growth -- has it been -- is it more and more weighted\\ntowards a -- maybe a disproportionately smaller percentage of agencies? Has that changed over the\\nyears? I know commission structure did change a number of years ago too. And it seems like it worked out\\nokay sales didn\\'t fall apart. Maybe you could -- any color there would be great.\\nThomas Joseph Wilson\\nChairman President & CEO\\nI mean what Glenn\\'s -- what our strategy is to have all of our agents growing and all of them be\\nproductive.\\nAs you point out not all of them get there every year. Sometimes that\\'s what we do in a local market or\\nwhat -- the local market conditions. Some of that\\'s what they do or what they don\\'t do. So we don\\'t -- this\\ncommission change wasn\\'t to address a problem. It was to seize an opportunity. And I think commission is\\n-- we move commissions around frequently like it\\'s not -- it\\'s -- it happens all the time. People do it in all\\nthe businesses we\\'re in. And our goal is to make sure that their objectives are aligned with our objectives.\\nThank you all for -- let me just close by saying thank you. We had a good 2019. We\\'re focused on\\ntransformative growth in 2020 and we\\'ll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation in today\\'s conference. This does conclude the\\nprogram. You may now disconnect. Good day.\\nCopyright © 2020 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc.
