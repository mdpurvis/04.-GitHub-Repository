We weren't getting base.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"We had concentrations
of risk where you just couldn't keep that concentration and we're taking it all net and we were getting
price paid for anything.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"So you start -- we've cut volatility out of this company by taking the limits
down that takes premium out of the pipe.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
We raised retentions that takes premium out of the pipe.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Yes
we've raised rates we've also bought reinsurance takes premiums out of pipe.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"So we have not been
concentrating on the top line because we had to concentrate on the bottom line.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
That's -- so once you get a base that you believe is sustainable then you grow it.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And so we want to grow
the business but we're going to concentrate on making sure this portfolio is rock solid.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"That's the #1
priority.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Okay.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Okay.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Elyse you got another question?,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
Yes.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And then my second question Mark in your guidance commentary you pointed to an accident year
combined ratio of 93.8% to 94.8% in General Insurance.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"I recognize some of the expense figures you
gave are exit run rates of $300 million for 2020 but if I kind of do some rough math it seems like of
that improvement that you'll see over the next 12 months about half should come from the underlying
loss ratio and half from the expense ratio.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Does that feel about right given the expense program and the
guidance you laid out?",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Mark Donald Lyons
Executive VP & CFO
Well I'd say probably skewed more and more to the loss ratio.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And as we go from '20 to '21 you see --
probably see that flip some degree of improvement.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Brian Charles Duperreault
Chief Executive Officer
Okay.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Next question please.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Operator
We'll go next to Erik Bass of Autonomous Research.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Erik James Bass
Autonomous Research LLP
And I appreciate the additional guidance details.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Just wanted to ask a bigger picture question.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"If you could
help us kind of bridge the gap to the 10% ROE by year-end '21 or it seems relative to 2019 Life and
Retirement facing a little bit of pressure.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"So can you help us just think about the contribution from GI
margin expansion in AIG 200 to get there?",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
And are there any other major moving pieces to consider?,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt

AMERICAN INTERNATIONAL GROUP INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 13 2020
Well to get -- I guess a couple of things you guys to think about is I think as I tried to lay out the 8.3%
return in calendar 2019 had some extraordinary gains in it.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"So if you normalize for that and things of that
nature it's not quite the same.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"I also think in the prior quarter I've mentioned that get to 10% is not
linear that we would expect more in the back half than the first half of that.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"We have great expansion in
GI on expected underwriting gain.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And although there is a stronger marketplace environment it's also
a radically modified portfolio.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"So by the time we're in 2021 we'll have a little more back of the window
view of what 2020 looks like.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And if we were lucky enough that the environment continues that's a great
tailwind to help us out.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
AIG 200 is going to also help along the lines we just mentioned.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"So there should be incrementally better
contributions from AIG 200 each year through 2021.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Brian Charles Duperreault
Chief Executive Officer
We expect L&R to be stable in this environment.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Maybe the ROEs have come down a little bit as we
discussed.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
But we'd expect L&R to be stable and it wheels around the GI improvements it's loss ratio now.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
With AIG 200 kicks in it will be expense ratios coming later.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Erik James Bass
Autonomous Research LLP
Got it.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
And then just one follow-up on Life and Retirement guidance.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"I think you talked about $200 million
or so drag from spread compression but based on the sensitivity Kevin that you gave on the equity
markets I would think you would see some of that or much of it offset given the gains we saw last year.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
So are there other pieces to factor in that would kind of get you to the lower earnings next year?,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Kevin Timothy Hogan
Executive VP and CEO of Life & Retirement
Well Erik as I pointed out I mean our assumptions are for -- from the starting point of the year 6.5%
on the equity markets.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And that the 10-year will be around 1.7% and the sensitivities that we gave were
relative to those assumptions.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Brian Charles Duperreault
Chief Executive Officer
Okay.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Next question.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Operator
We'll move next to Brian Meredith at UBS.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
Yes just 2 for me here quickly.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"On the GOE is some of that -- on the AIG 200 is some of that going to
come from loss adjustment expenses?",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And then maybe you can frame it a little bit how much kind of
Corporate versus General Insurance?",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Brian Charles Duperreault
Chief Executive Officer
Peter do you want to take that?",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Peter Salvatore Zaffino

Yes.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
So no we do not contemplate an AIG 200 the loss adjustment expense Brian.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And then in terms
of the way we framed out the program.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt

the sequencing of that I think it will be fairly consistent throughout the 3 years.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
Got you.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
It's helpful.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
And then my second one just a little clarification and sorry to kind of go on this one.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"But if I look at your ROE in 2022 when we come out here we know that Legacy is going to cause call it
over $3 billion hit to your equity.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"When we take a look at that return on equity will if I add back that $3.5
billion FF equity will we still have a double-digit return on equity in 2022?",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Mark Donald Lyons
Executive VP & CFO
I'll take that one.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
I have 2 things that are kind of countervailing -- actually 3 things come to mind.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"First
off when we originally said the 10% we had a completely different investment environment investment
outlook.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"So from that point of view having the Fortitude sale the impact on that is very helpful to offset
some of the investment income outlook differences.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And the other thing is the $3 billion number that's
approximately that you talked about that's the impact on -- the impact from consolidation as opposed to
the impact from sale.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And impact from sale is subfunction of whatever the market conditions are going to
be on the day of closing.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"So equity part...

Hard to predict.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
I know it's complicated.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Hopefully that helps.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
That's good.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Brian Charles Duperreault
Chief Executive Officer
Let's take maybe one more question.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Operator
I will take that question from Suneet Kamath from Citi.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Suneet Laxman L. Kamath
Citigroup Inc Research Division
Just a follow-up on Brian's question on the equity.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"As we think about kind of the half to the 10% is there
a capital return or share buyback expectation that's built into that guidance?",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"I know you talked about
delevering but just want to get a sense of what we should think about in terms of getting to that 10%?",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Brian Charles Duperreault
Chief Executive Officer
Well we're both looking at each other.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Mark and I.,2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And I'd say look we'd expect that as we manage our
capital we told you what our priorities are for this year.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"We're going to look at -- once we do close the
Fortitude we will relook at share buybacks which just probably move to second half of the year.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"It's still a
management tool.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt

Yes I think what we're going to try to do in the first quarter is just give you a little bit more clarity on
the sequencing.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And so while we have 10 initiatives and they'll largely be launched in the first quarter
there will be sequencing in terms of where we start.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And giving you a little bit more insight as to how
that program progresses.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And then I think that will tie to where Mark said before which is what type of
expense needs to be deployed with that sequencing to match expenditures and getting after this launch.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt

programs and what it looks like for the rest of 2020.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt

lot more clarity on perhaps the timing of capital being put in service you capitalize things being put in
service but clearly above and below the line aspect.",2019-12-31 AIG Transcript.txt

"If we
can get a sense of what you define as the long term?",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

"Thomas Joseph Wilson
Chairman President & CEO
Elyse thanks for the question.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
First -- let me deal with the second question first.,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We're not going to give
out a number for 2020 which goes to your first question which is we kind of look at this kind of like a
rolling 3-year basis is like over a 3- year period caps go up and down things go up and down and we
should be able to earn a 14% to 17% return.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
We got there by really looking at a couple of things.,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"First is
what's a level of economic rent we can capture by how good we are in the market we operate in.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And so
as you know in the Property-Liability business we run a substantially more favorable combined ratio than
the industry and that's worth a substantial amount of economic return.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We also look at it from what's the
appropriate risks -- what's the appropriate return for the risks that our shareholders take.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And we feel like
14% to 17% is a good goal for us to have over that 3-year basis.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

"There's a lot of
better ways to do a forecast.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We're not going to break it out by component because our goal here was to

ratio we basically zoomed ourselves in including you all into how well was auto insurance doing that

"So the Annuities as we've talked
about before are a large drag on that.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

has on ROE to the other businesses you would say the other businesses are higher return.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

most of that is Property-Liability.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

"We also have obviously a longer-term plan which is our
performance stock awards which are tied to return on equity.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

It's Mario.,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
I just would add a couple of things.,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"So first I think we're --
continue to be pleased with the progress we're making on expenses.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And as Tom talked about earlier it's
a core part of our transformative growth strategy and one of the ways that we're going to further improve
the customer value proposition and create the capacity for the growth investments that he alluded to.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"So
our work in this area is not done.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We're going to keep focusing on expenses and look to drive down the
expense ratio.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"One thing I'll add with the fourth quarter specifically the impairment charge related to the
Esurance brand was worth about 0.6 point on the expense ratio.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"So if you look year-over-year you see
some real meaningful improvement in the expense ratio in the quarter.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"That gets a little bit masked by
that nonrecurring charge.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Charles Gregory Peters

Is that -- Mario is that where the Esurance expense ratio is?",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
I think was up 27.5% in the fourth quarter.,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Is that what you're talking about?,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Mario Rizzo
Executive VP & CFO
Yes it's in the expense ratio.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"It's worth about 0.6 for the overall Property-Liability number obviously more

Great.,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
The second question I guess let's pivot to the performance-based investments.,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Obviously
it's generated a strong result for you over a long period of time but there's volatility.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And this past year
there was volatility.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And for outside observers can you provide any guidance for us on how we should

"John's created and uses a really comprehensive capital
allocation framework that helps the investment team decide what and when to invest.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And it keeps track
of the decisions we made not just the investments we made but -- so we can track those.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"But also any
opportunities missed or any losses we avoided.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"So we watch our money well and that's on all parts of
the portfolio.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

means.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

"It's -- majority
of it's invested in high quality fixed income instruments and then about 18% of that is equity and
roughly half of that is performance-based.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

"It allows us to create in our belief a more efficient frontier a more
efficient portfolio that's well suited to our overall liability and capital structure.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"What comes with that is
increased volatility on income.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
And we believe that -- and we will -- we expect volatility.,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We'll expect it
in the past and we'll expect it going forward.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We believe that we're compensated for that volatility of
income.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"In this particular quarter that volatility especially if you look at it year-over-year on a quarterly basis
the difference was $97 million.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
About $74 million of that was tied to 2 investments.,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"That obviously
was a disappointment but we've gone back in and we recognize that when you look at the underlying
investments here they range from timber and agriculture to real estate to private equity to a number of
different investments in there.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"It's hard to pin down with great precision in any given quarter how that's
going to play out.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
So I would expect continued volatility.,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"But we have also gone through in as part of our
regular risk and surveillance processes looked at all of our holdings as we normally would do and believe
that this was not a -- this was a bit of a one-off type of quarter.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
We remain confident in the effort going forward.,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Despite this -- the performance in this quarter we believe
we have a strong team.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

"We
look to 3 5 and 10 year and some of those measures are in the investor supplement.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And those tend to
be holding true.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
So we really aren't changing our overall commitment to it.,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

"But our philosophy has been to -- for -- as you know
profitable growth and long-term profitable growth.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

the trends show we should do it.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

"The other thing I would say is you always have to be careful of the percentages
because it always depends where you start.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
So we have some competitors who are higher price than us.,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

"And other carriers who are lower than us on certain risks and they're

And as Tom said I think it -- I'll lead you to one set of numbers that I think tells the story.,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Our average premium in auto was up 3% year-over-year and our average loss and expense was up 2.5%.,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"So we were disciplined in managing to a positive return and actually made a little progress during a time
where as you said it was very very competitive out there.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We did see some competitors take sort of
broad-based rate reductions which is why the overall CPI is negative that as Tom said not a trend we'll
follow or something we subscribe to.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
We look state-by-state.,2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"To your question about what we're seeing
more recently is it stabilizing I would say I'll give you a qualified yes.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

activity starting to flow into the market.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

the recent past.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

some restricted rules on it which we started to open those up now.",2019-12-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

"Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
I guess first question Evan a very high-level question and I kind of apologize in advance it's kind of a
generic question but I really want to get your thoughts on this.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Look the industry is reacting to I guess
sins of the past if you will from pricing and the reactionary nature of the industry.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"You seemly don't
have to do that as much because your prior year stuff was already strong.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And so the question here is
kind of more of how do you think about -- the answer is really your account-by-account detail of your
underwriting at which you guys do phenomenally well.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"But at a high level Evan how do you steer the
ship with thinking about just the trade-off between -- you have a cushion that you could maybe not really
worry about margin expansion as much because you've got such great envious margins and think about
the growth that you could possibly get even higher growth if you gave up a little bit more on the margin
expansion.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"So just kind of a high level how you think about that tug-of-war between the pricing that you
want to get the growth you want to get versus the margins that you get on that.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
I don't think about it that way and not how an underwriting organization really thinks about it.,2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Your
question is in a sense too simplistic.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We quote the rates and prices and underwriting terms that we
require in each line of business to earn what we think is an adequate risk-adjusted return as expressed
by a combined ratio in that line of business.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"It then all mixes together in portfolio which you then see as
an overall published average combined ratio.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And so you can't -- in the Commercial P&C business which
runs higher than the average that you look at at the whole company you then dig down by line and
there are lines of business that are -- that we think are adequate now or maybe a bit above adequate in
some cases and there are lines of business that are below adequate and we'll continue to drive for rate.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Wherever we see adequacy and we like the risk-reward we're hardly holding back on growth.,2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And I think
the question is a little ironic this quarter when you're asking it in the backdrop of fundamentally a 10%
growth rate on an organization of this size.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt

ratio how to think about that in 2020.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"I mean it looks like it's ticked up a bit throughout '19 more on the
acquisition expense.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt

"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
It's pretty simple.,2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"About 1/3 of it is -- of the increase is related to onetime items last year that
benefited last year's expense ratio.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"About 1/3 of it is mix of business where it's business that runs a lower

"And the third is investments we've been making in
certain businesses particularly in Asia and to a degree in Latin America to grow -- for future growth.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt

we'll grow into our sleeves there and the expense ratio will ameliorate and improve.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt

"In primary casualty we're
seeing severity stable.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt

"You also painted a picture of a lot of price going to your book that you said continued into
2020.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt

in the range if not better in the '20 underwriting year is my sense of it but no guarantees.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt

always a little volatility quarter-to-quarter given some seasonality and mix of business.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"So you never see
it in just some steady steady way.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
On pricing I think it endures.,2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
The fundamentals speak to it.,2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt

environment I imagine will continue for some time.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt

spreading more broadly.",2019-12-31 Chubb Transcript.txt

"New sales for auto and home were up 36% over prior year with
improving retentions all contributing towards the goal of future net written premium growth.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Group Benefits had an outstanding year with core earnings of $539 million up $112 million from
2018 with a core earnings margin of 8.9%.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"This performance was largely due to a 3-point loss ratio
improvement over prior year reflecting continued favorable disability incidence trends and strong disability
claim recoveries partially offset by elevated life severity experienced earlier in the year.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
On the top line fully insured ongoing premiums were flat to prior year.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Fully insured ongoing sales for
2019 were $647 million down $57 million as prior year included first year sales related to the new Paid

incidence risk and recovery trends in long-term disability.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"January sales were solid in a competitive market
but were down slightly from 2019 due to fewer large case sales.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Before turning the call over to Doug I'll provide my perspective on a couple macro themes.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"First social
inflation continues to dominate industry conversations as the current hot topic.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Last quarter I said that
social inflation was not a new phenomenon.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
A quarter later my view hasn't changed.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But there are a
few points to make.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I expect some level of social inflation will be felt by many carriers if not all across
the industry.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
However the impact on loss costs will vary by company.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Variation depends on several
factors including the line of business and coverage limits; type of coverage such as primary umbrella
or excess; specific contractual terms; and reinsurance programs.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Each company's ability to react to
social inflation will be impacted by the quality of data and analytics supporting product pricing and loss
reserve estimates.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"At The Hartford I feel confident that we are -- that our analytical capabilities along
with our talented claims and legal professionals have allowed us to build a track record of making timely
adjustments to loss cost assumptions reflected in our financial results over the past 4 to 5 years.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
The second topic is interest rates.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"For several quarters we have discussed the impact of a persistent low
interest rate environment on the ability to grow net investment income.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Currently our portfolio continues
to perform well but it is clear that the interest rate environment is becoming more challenging.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"This will
impact the investment returns on new cash flows reinvestment rates and our overall portfolio yield.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"The
implication is that net investment income will likely become a headwind to core earnings growth requiring
higher levels of underwriting income to support earnings and ROE.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"This coupled with loss cost trends
leads me to believe the firming cycle we are experiencing will likely continue for the next 18 to 24 months.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"In closing when I look out to 2020 and beyond I think about how far our businesses have evolved
over the past decade and how well positioned The Hartford is as a market leader.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We have expanded
underwriting capabilities and provide a broad range of products delivered through multiple distribution
channels to meet customer needs in a dynamic market environment.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We are focused on execution
integration innovation and maximizing our enhanced capabilities to organically grow the business.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

performance and innovation over the years with a focus on the customer experience.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

classes of business.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

improving and we have identified attractive opportunities to cross-sell specialty products.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

"We
continue to look for opportunities to drive top line growth.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And finally in Group Benefits we are nearing the completion of integration activities.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

future growth stemming from new products and services designed to complement existing risk products
while improving the customer experience.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

and positive impact on society as an essential element of our ongoing success.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

making this happen by always doing the right thing fostering a workplace where everyone is welcome and
respected using our resources and influence to address the challenge of changing climate and helping to
make our communities where we live and work be safer and more successful.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I'm very proud that these
sustainability efforts are widely recognized as industry-leading.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"In summary I'm confident our enhanced capabilities in a firming market combined with ongoing capital
management provide the opportunity for The Hartford to enhance value for all our stakeholders.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

"Through year-end we've delivered

"This positive start provides confidence that we

thoughts about 2020.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

development primarily on Navigators international reserves.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

slightly better than our performance for 2019.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

liability and property lines partially offset by margin compression in workers' compensation as negative
rates earn through our book.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

what you're seeing in terms of rate pressure in the business.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

Sure Jimmy.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Let's take each of the pieces.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"On the workers' comp side 2 different dynamics one with our
small commercial sector where we're seeing negative pricing and have very little ability to do anything
about it relative to underwriting.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So those rates -- those negative rates flow through.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"On the Middle
Market side largely a flattish environment.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And so that means we're dealing with account experience
sector performance and doing our best to work against the negative file trends across the various states.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So that's the workers' comp situation.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Relative to auto I would describe auto as an ongoing work in process here over the last 8 years.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
We've been working on auto which is why I think you don't see the surprises in the quarter.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

strengthened auto over the last 6 7 accident years.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We strengthened a little bit in the third quarter but
felt very good about where our position was for Q4.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

"How much of this are you seeing companies begin to reflect in their

a normalized basis I would say 0.7 decline due to net investment income 0.8 of a decline due to again
normalized loss ratios.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And we're going to spend some incremental dollars in our infrastructure there.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

there's a little bit of expense pressure.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

major ones are obviously net investment income improved loss ratio performance and to a lesser extent
expense savings.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I think we also talked about Elyse on a short-term or near-term basis we still see approximately
$110 million of core earnings in 2020.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And for the Navigators business that will flow through the new
Global Specialty segment.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So that's again at the lower end of our range primarily due to the interest rate
environment.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

year period of time primarily due just to the rate environment and the improvement of possibilities that
we are planning for and seeing in the book.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Really pleased with the entire team and Doug could give you
more insights and analysis on it.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

Chris I would just add absolutely that we are bullish about what we think we'll achieve in 2020.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"The
other thing is that the accumulation of underwriting actions that were taken across the book between
change in limit profile attachment points exiting classes adjusting MGA capacity underwriting limits
et cetera are also going to be a core driver of that performance change.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And I'm very encouraged by
the actions that not only we've taken but will continue to take into 2020.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

"Yes we're encouraged about the pricing and that
provides an awful lot of our tone.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

Yes.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And the only thing I'd add to that and I think Chris touched on this but your point about our original
projections on investment income are obviously correct.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
The rate environment is different.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

seeing more expense benefit than we originally anticipated and the offset of those 2 pretty much wash
each other out.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

any timing to think about in terms of when you can get some of the dividends from the subs or the tax
attributes?",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

"So as we think about the cash flow to the holding company over the year I
really see those building over the year.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Some of the tax benefits come in over the course of time but a
big chunk of that comes in with the AMT refund which is really predicated on when the IRS accepts our
tax return and when that's filed.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So from a pace of share repurchase I would expect that to be increasing
over the year and not necessarily ratable throughout the year.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And then as far as tax attributes when we look towards 2021 based on our expectation of utilization
this year I expect that when we get to 2021 we'll probably just be in sort of the normal course of tax
benefits coming to the holding company related to the deduction we get on interest expense through our
normal tax sharing arrangement.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

of kind of where we are from a pricing versus underlying claim cost environment.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Paul sure let me tackle that one.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
This is Doug.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We're obviously pleased about our financial performance
in 2019.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
You see the pricing is down a bit.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I think it's down a bit commensurate with where we see loss
trends.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So as I've commented frequency has been in very good shape for now an extended series of
quarters.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And we're watching carefully severity.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
We're watching physical damage in particular.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But the
aggregate of both frequency and severity put the loss trend in the low single digits and I think that's
where we are from a pricing perspective.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So I feel like we're right on top of it.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Now we also have goals to move our new business north.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So we will address pricing and new business
targets et cetera as we move through 2020 because we'd like to further stimulate new business growth.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But I think we've done a nice job at getting the book healthy from a profit perspective and we'll continue
to balance both growth and profit as we go through 2020 and beyond.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

And then my second question is I'd like to know a little bit more about persistency particularly just across
the property/casualty businesses.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And normally in a harder market you have decreases in persistency.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Do
you think that's going to happen prospectively as well until the market flattens out?",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Paul there are so many pieces to the marketplace.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"If we talked about it on the extremes you could
move to Small Commercial and I would say that that's just a very competitive world not a lot of change
from where we've been in the last couple of years.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And then you could move into either public D&O or
the excess casualty world that is going through enormous amount of change and the dynamics around
pricing and retention are very different across those sectors.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So yes where you see capacity shortage and
people are driving rate because of their performance which I think is where the market is and some of
these challenged financial classes there may be some dynamics across the retention element but we are
determined to get rate where we need it in our book.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And so I think we have got a very good sense of where that rate need exists across our various products.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And if we have to give up a little bit on the retention side to get what we need to do on the pricing I'm
willing to make that trade particularly in Middle Market and Global Specialty where our returns have to
get better.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

The next question comes from David Motemaden of Evercore ISI.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities Research Division
Just for Chris or Doug on the Commercial Lines outlook for 2020.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Maybe -- I'm just wondering if you could
elaborate a bit more on the 92 to 94 underlying combined ratio guide after the call it 94.5% to 95% that
you guys printed in the second half of '19.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And I think Chris you mentioned 5- to 6-point improvement
on Navigators in 2020.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

other moving pieces that get you confident that you can get there given the results this quarter.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
David let me start and then I'll ask Doug to comment.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So it feels like it's like deja vu all over again.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"This
time last year a lot of our tone was -- is similar to this year right?",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"You have a workers' comp dynamic
that we are going to face some pressure with price but generally loss costs there are behaving.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And
then you have I'll call it all the other lines that I think will contribute to margin expansion going forward
particularly the specialty line.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So sort of it's a tale of a coin there 2 sides of the coin.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But you put them all together and we do still see
at least from where our run rate ended in 2019 the ability to expand margins on an overall book basis
offsetting some of the pressure we see in comp with the strong pricing in liability property commercial
auto and obviously our specialty line.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So Doug that's what I would say as sort of a macro perspective.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Yes.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
I agree with that Chris.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I would also add that we saw a little bit of a bump-up in the quarter for some
accruals on the expense side.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So the expense piece also is running a little abnormally high in the quarter.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But when I adjust for the expense piece some noise with Navigators and then the encouragement of
what's happening on the pricing side I really do feel like 2020 is achievable.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Yes we have a lot of work to
get done to make that happen but I believe we will.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And I think we're off to a terrific start as we closed
'19 and entered 2020 to get our numbers moving.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

Great.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

profile that you were making for 2020.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

average in limit size is for you guys ex workers' comp and what changes are you implementing.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot

When I talk about limit profile I'm primarily talking about Navigators and our excess casualty book

do we take limits greater than $10 million.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

Doug I guess first of all on workers' comp did you say in the prepared remarks that that was a 1-point
drag this year on the accident year combined ratio or just on the workers' comp picks?",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

Okay.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And I guess in the outlook for 2020 are you thinking about a similar type of drag from comp?,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Or do
you expect that to accelerate?",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

President
The 0.5 point across our book is what we're expecting in 2020.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

across our lines I think that's a good approximate number to use.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

Autonomous Research LLP
Got it.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And then I guess just on Navigators the 5 to 6 points it sounds like that could come from 3 areas.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

underwriting improvement remediation.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

divvy it up between those 3?",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

expenses that come out of the equation.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So that is also a part of it.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

because they'll be embedded in losses and will be very difficult to know a loss that you've been able to
either moderate or avoid versus an underwriting action taken.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
I don't think that's measurable.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

that you have a handle on that you wouldn't necessarily expect to recur.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

frequency-based and there's a bit more severity in the Navigators book.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

them in the quarter and moved our accident year pickup accordingly.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

still have to figure out what the right base is to launch from.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

"Doug I just wanted to follow up a little bit on what David was talking about as far as limit
profile at Navigators.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

I don't think so Brian.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

excess casualty portfolio as well.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So their umbrella and excess limit product is certainly under enormous
interest right now.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
The market is searching for capacity.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And so I think we have deep experienced
professionals in that space a lot of interest on the part of many of our long-term Hartford retail brokers
and agents.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

trends in mid-single digit in primary and higher in excess.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

that earned rate will accelerate much faster than what you have seen and hence outpace the loss cost?",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

described.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

"Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Amit I would say in line with expectations.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
There isn't anything outside of norm that we see.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Doug
talked about litigation rates and representation rates that have been generally stable for us over the last
3 or 4 years.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So we've had to make some adjustments.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We didn't get everything right over a 6- 7-year
period here but I think we're on top of it.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And we're managing the best way we can and being proactive
not only looking back at data but actually trying to think what can happen going forward.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Chris and that's absolutely true for The Hartford book.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"What I would add on top of that is that probably in
the excess area we see a little bit more severity a little bit more social inflation than maybe we expected
a year ago.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And that's also driving our price increases in the marketplace.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So I didn't expect to be looking
at a fourth quarter in '19 12 months prior in the mid-teens but I think we need it.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And as we better
understand that book we're driving the price increases that need to chase that loss trend.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So I feel we're
on top of it and pleased that our HIG book continues to perform about the way we expected.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
And Amit that's why we did the reinsurance transaction with National Indemnity on Navigators was to
really take that tail risk off until we got our arms fully around it.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Obviously we paid a premium for that
but I still like that trade we did given some of the uncertainty in the marketplace today on social inflation.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Operator
The next question comes from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG Research Division
First question on Group Benefits.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Clearly phenomenal results.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Curious Chris in your prepared remarks I
believe you said you're kind of assuming more normalized incidence and recovery trends.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So in the 2020
guidance has HIG changed its incidence trend or recovery assumptions to kind of reflect an improved
trend line?",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Or are you just kind of thinking last year was more of an anomaly?,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
I would say Michael that our assumptions and methodologies are generally consistent over the years.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We
haven't changed anything in how we think about setting reserves or pricing product which generally uses
I call it a mean average approach so that we're not using the most recent dot in an incidence report.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
We're taking more of a 5-year period of time.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So there is a little bit of mean averaging going in there as
far as our assumptions.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So -- but it's been consistent between years.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG Research Division
Okay.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
That's helpful.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Lastly and I need to delve more into it but it looks like the catastrophe reinsurance
program might be purchasing a little bit more reinsurance.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And if that's correct that could be behind
the CAT load guidance coming in slightly below last year's guidance.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Is that correct?,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And if so is there --
should we be baking in any -- a higher underlying loss ratio from the increased spend?",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Beth Costello

"spglobal.com/marketintelligence 19
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 04 2020
Executive VP & CFO
Yes.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So a couple of things.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And I would say relatively speaking our program is very consistent.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We did
purchase down in the aggregate treaty.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And overall when we look at the spend for the whole program and
the various changes we made it's really not a significant delta from the prior year.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And as far as the CAT ratio guide at -- being in total kind of where we came at this year that's not
reflective of any changes in the reinsurance program.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"It's really just looking at underlying exposures and
as we ran our models.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And it's really I think only slightly down -- is down slightly from last year.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG Research Division
And Beth if I could sneak one last one in.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Did you -- is there -- did you comment on the -- on PG&E
whether that refund has that come through?",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And if it does would that be used towards capital
management?",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Beth Costello
Executive VP & CFO
Yes.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So I did not comment -- update our comments on PG&E.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We continue to watch as that activity
continues.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
We have not booked any recovery associated with the plans that are underway.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We'll continue
to watch what the final program is that comes out of bankruptcy.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And yes I mean overall that -- any
benefits that we receive net of what we would have to reimburse our reinsurers for would improve the
capital position in P&C.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
But I wouldn't make a direct link to that to an increase in share repurchases.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"It will
just go into the mix relative to capital resources.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Operator
And the last question today comes from Michael Phillips of Morgan Stanley.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
One more if I could on the outlook on commercial and from the expense side.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I guess there's a lot of
moving parts obviously on your expense ratio.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"You've talked about higher commissions defending your
Small Commercial.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
I don't know when that ends if you could talk about that.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Investments the benefits of
which could accrue at some point you're still making investments.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So talk about the expense ratio there.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And then Doug mentioned some accruals or whatever that happened in this quarter that kind of bumped
it up a bit so I'm not sure the impact on that.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But as we think about 2020 on the expense ratio side kind
of what's a good starting point?",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
34.5-ish looks like maybe for the year-end.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Is that a bit high?,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And how do
you expect that to move in 2020?",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Michael it's Chris.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I would say again the context to the number that I'm going to give you is we've
been on a program to invest in our platform whether it be call it technology whether it be digital
whether it be product and underwriting.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
We've been on a journey.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And we've talked about sort of the
elevation in our expense ratio primarily due to the invest side.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I would say where we ended 2019 on a full year basis in that 32.5 to 33 Commercial and Personal Lines
together keep GB separate for the time being is a good number for next year to maybe slightly down.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I think we're coming to the point in that long-term program that we've put into place where the invest
dollars are going to begin to slow down once we finish second half of 2020 heading into '21.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I think we are
a larger-scale organization or a growth-orientated firm that will continue to add premium again properly
priced and good business.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So all that would point to particularly as we get out into '21 and beyond I'll call it a stairstep back to a
normalized and competitive expense ratio over time.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So -- but again we've been deliberate about what we

"spglobal.com/marketintelligence 20
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC. FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 04 2020
needed to do as an organization we think to create value and be competitive long term.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And we're not
backing away from that but we're at the tail end of the program.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
That's what I would say Doug and Beth.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
Great.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Okay.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Great.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
That's helpful.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And then I guess my last one kind of more higher level.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Chris in your
opening comments you talked about the momentum in pricing.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"You were talking about the overall market
not just you guys I believe you were.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And I think you said you expect it to continue for 18 to 24 months
from here.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
I guess -- hopefully I heard you right.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
If that's the case kind of what's behind that to you?,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
That's a pretty long extension.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And so what do you think is going to keep driving pricing up for the next 2
years?",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Well getting to ultimately target ratios that support an adequate return for the risk the industry is taking.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
I outlined low interest rates.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
That's going to be a little bit of a headwind.,2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But if I look at product lines
and where comp is headed I mean -- and again from managing the book of business you never really
want to shock your book of business and go to a 50% retention rate.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So generally what you try to do is
be thoughtful on retentions but firm and disciplined and work through your distribution partners to talk
through the actions that are going to be required in the near term and over a longer period of time.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And I
just think given where we're starting from and given some of the pressure on social inflation and liability
cost commercial auto in general it's going to take 2 years to get back to target margins.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Operator
This concludes our question-and-answer session.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I'll now turn the call back to Ms. Susan Spivak for closing
remarks.",2019-12-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

"Core return on equity
was 14.8%.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As you've heard us say before the primary measure we use to manage our business is core
return on equity over time and any strategy to deliver industry-leading returns requires a strategy to
grow also over time.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

the top line at attractive returns resulted in record net written premiums of more than $29 billion.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

significant.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

underwriting income.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

Premium growth in 2019 and over the past 3 years has been driven by higher pricing with both pure rate
and exposure growth contributing.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The new business we've added has been in products industries and
geographies that we know well.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
So we're growing with confidence.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Improvements in productivity and efficiency complement the benefit of volume.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"This quarter our
expense ratio improved to 29.1% bringing our full year expense ratio to 29.6%.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"That marks a steady
and substantial improvement over the past 3 years from an expense ratio which prior to that had
averaged around 32%.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"This was driven by our efforts to leverage technology investments and workflow
enhancements.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

Question and Answer

[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
My first question I'm thinking about Slide 9 and specifically the bottom of Slide 9.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I know you guys talk
about kind of longer-term trends of 4% to 4.5% that gives a 4.5% the last time and I know you focus on
long-term trends.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But you've moved that up a bit in the last couple of quarters more on kind of the catch-
up which you again referred to here in Slide 9.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So I'm wondering if you still think that 4.5% is something
you're comfortable with.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Or how you think about that going forward now?,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Daniel Stephen Frey
Executive VP & CFO
Michael it's Dan Frey.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So I'll draw the distinction between sort of the long-term trend assumption and
what's going to roll through any particular quarter or any year.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So in that slide we're reconciling for you
the difference between last year's combined ratio and this year's combined ratio.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And clearly for the year
as a whole when we look at the change in the loss environment overall it was more than 4.5%.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
We did remember raise our view of the long-term trend.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I think we talked about that back in the second
quarter.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
But we haven't changed it since then.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So these are more reactions to data that we're seeing in the
current environment raising the level of losses but not the trajectory from this point forward.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
Okay.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I mean I guess obviously what I'm getting to is that tug of war between pricing and loss trends
and kind of who wins that tug of war right now.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And obviously this quarter the tug of war went to loss
trends because margins were down but a lot of your commentary talks about the outlook being better for
the underlying certainly I think you said starting in the second quarter.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So you're still thinking that pricing
-- earned pricing will get better than loss trends as we get into the back half of this year it sounds like.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Is
that what you're saying?",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Daniel Stephen Frey
Executive VP & CFO
Yes that's full year.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So remember the outlook is really a 12-month broad view of what we think the
environment is going to be as opposed to a quarter-by-quarter reconciliation.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The comment Greg made is
that when we compare Q1 in particular of '20 to Q1 of '19 the strengthening that we've done for 2019
came in Q2 Q3 and Q4 primarily.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So that comparison in and of itself is going to be a little different than
the year more broadly.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Michael it's Alan.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I would also just encourage you to make sure you're looking at Slide 10 too because
there's a lot of moving pieces in Slide 9 that when you look at it on a full year basis it's just -- it's a little
bit of an easier view to take in.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

confirm that.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And then if so I guess what's driving that?,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Are you seeing kind of -- is that more of kind of
the tort environment leaking down from GL into the smaller accounts of CMP liability?",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

driving that piece?",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Daniel Stephen Frey
Executive VP & CFO
Yes Michael it's Dan again.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
So I'd say broadly yes.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And I'd remind you that if you go back and look at
the results we've disclosed throughout the year even going back to Q1 of this year we did talk about CMP
as being an unfavorable contributor to prior year reserve development and BI even going back to Q1.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And clearly as you're alluding to CMP has got both a property and a liability component.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"It is the liability
component.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But as we've made comments over the second third and now fourth quarters of this year

liability component of CMP as opposed to this being something new and different.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

Your next question is from Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

I guess I'm just asking a qualitative question.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Where you sit today or feel today versus where things
stood coming out of the third quarter obviously you're pushing -- this is all about Business Insurance.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Obviously you're pushing price.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"To some extent you're shooting at a moving target with loss trend and
all the issues surrounding that.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Is there -- you've got -- you've now got another quarter just looking back
to from the third.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Is there any way to say that you're more comfortable with where you sit today and
what you're seeing and how the relationship with pricing and loss trend is moving?",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Just looking for some
qualitative thoughts on that.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Yes Larry it's Alan.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Let me take a stab at that.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So first I would say we are definitely pleased with the
trajectory of rate versus loss trend.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
That continues to be a good story.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And importantly you got to look at
retention in that regard.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"That's hanging in there which suggests we think this is an environmental thing
and we would say that the pricing actions have room to go here.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In terms of our overall sense of the balance sheet we are closer to the end of this than we were a year
ago that's for sure.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And what we're very confident in is we're confident in the talent we've got looking at
this we're confident in our processes we're confident in our data and analytics and we're confident that
we understand the environment out there.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
So very confident in our best estimate.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Can we tell you this is the end of it.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Of course not.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
We couldn't and nobody could.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But that -- I don't
mean to imply any lack of confidence in again the data analytics people process here.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"This is an
environmental issue and we think we're on top of it.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Lawrence David Greenberg

And then just as a follow-up you talk about the other levers that you might have in addition to pricing.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Are you willing to share any of those other levers to go at this environmental issue?,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer

you solve those issues.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

"And that's true in our best-performing
businesses and our worst-performing businesses.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So you go through that process and there are always
things that we can do better and we will do those things.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"When we look at this environment in particular relative to our overall book of business there are around
the edges accounts or segments of the business that we think in the current environment don't make
sense and we'll either get the right rate or we'll get off them.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And then probably to the question you're really asking is what we're doing from a claim perspective.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And clearly the plaintiffs' bar is getting more sophisticated more clever more aggressive.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And I guess
in response to that I would say so are we.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
I'm not anxious to detail our tactics or strategies.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

that would probably be unwise for us to do that.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

Your next question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Jamminder Singh Bhullar
JP Morgan Chase & Co Research Division
I had a couple of questions.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
First just on the tort environment overall.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"You've been more vocal than most
other companies.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Just trying to understand is the environment stabilizing or has it gotten worse as you
went through 2019?",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And then the other question I just had is on your expense ratio which was very good for the year and for
the quarter.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
To what extent is it sustainable versus sort of being an aberration?,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Thanks for the question.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I'll start with the tort environment then I'll ask Dan to talk about the
expense ratio.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Clearly I think if you look at our results throughout the year we would say I don't know
if the environment's gotten worse but clearly the losses have come in worse than our expectations.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And
one thing you've got to remember is we are setting reserves for years in very long tail lines of business
where there is a very high percentage of IBNR.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
So the paid in case is a relatively small percentage of this.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And so we're squaring triangles.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We're looking
at the data as it comes in every quarter comparing it to our expectations and that's what has gotten
worse.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And I will say quarter in quarter out we have not responded gingerly.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We have responded
assertively to this and yet it's continued to come in a little bit worse than our expectations.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
But as I said before we are 5 quarters closer to the end of this than we were a year ago.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And again we
think we understand the market dynamics.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We think we understand what's causing this and we feel very
good about our analytics and our process.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Dan do you want to talk about the expense ratio?,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Daniel Stephen Frey
Executive VP & CFO
Sure.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So I'll focus you on the full year because there's going to be a little bit of variability from quarter-to-
quarter.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
So at 29.6% for the full year that's a range we're comfortable with now.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"It's certainly noticeably
better than it was several years ago and steady progress over the last 3 years.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I think everything comes back to the way we talk about the business consistently which is we're trying
to optimize returns over time.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"There's not really a specific targeted expense ratio although in the current
environment the level that we're at now is a level that plus or minus we're pretty comfortable with in this
environment.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
We've been able to get productivity and efficiency gains.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

"Jamminder Singh Bhullar
JP Morgan Chase & Co Research Division
Okay.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And if I could ask 1 more.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Just on Personal Auto I think you mentioned you expect margins to be
stable in 2020.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But if we look over the past couple of years the pace of price hikes has actually steadily
slowed and it seems like for the industry that's worse than this loss cost inflation.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So what gives you the
confidence that margins in Personal Auto won't get worse in 2020?",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Michael Frederick Klein
Executive VP & President of Personal Insurance
Sure Jimmy.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
This is Michael Klein.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
I would say a couple of things.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"One most of the rhetoric in the industry
about loss trend deterioration focuses on severity which is a piece of the puzzle and we certainly are
observing some of the same dynamics in terms of collision and physical damage severity that you're
seeing folks talk about as well as bodily injury severity.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
On the good news front has been frequency.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And as I mentioned we continued to see favorable frequency
better than our expectations sort of throughout 2019.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And we put those frequency and severity results
together with a longer-term view of loss trend and view loss trend as actually in aggregate relatively
consistent going into 2020.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And then the lower renewal premium change outlook is again on the margin.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And again lower but continued positive.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And so that's where we land on broadly consistent.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And again I think much like Greg's commentary in Personal Insurance rate versus loss trend is 1
dynamic that drives you to your outlook for a combined ratio but the other levers that you use to manage
the business including underwriting terms conditions claim process claim efficiencies come into that
view of the outlook as well.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So it's not just a linear roll forward of rate versus loss trend getting you to
that answer.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

Thanks for the question Mike.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

in terms of geography or business or line but I think the right way to answer that question is to take a
step back and look at the last year.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And when we take a step back and look at the last year we would say
it's been broadly across our casualty coverages geographically line of business and so on and so forth.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

"One we do say that it reflects lower and
more normalized expectation for a non-cat weather.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

a lower expectation than we saw in 2018.",2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

It in fact includes more loss content than it would have 2 or 3 or 4 years ago.,2019-12-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

"First we have Evan Greenberg Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft our Chief Financial Officer we'll then take your

Also with us to assist you with your questions are several members of our management team.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And now I'll
turn the call over to Evan.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Good morning.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We had a strong third quarter with core operating earnings up double digit and excellent
premium revenue growth globally.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Growth benefited from a continuously improving pricing and
underwriting environment where insurance rates and terms continued to firm quarter-over-quarter in
major areas of our business.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Our growth is also benefiting from our many product customer and distribution-related growth initiatives
around the globe particularly in the U.S. Asia and Latin America.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
Core operating income was $2.70 per share up 12%.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The balance of our earnings between underwriting
and investment income was very good with underwriting income of $754 million up 12.5% and adjusted
net investment income of $910 million up 3%.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
Global P&C underwriting income which excludes agriculture was up 27.7%.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The combined ratio was
90.2% and benefited from lower year-on-year cats offset partially by higher crop losses another cat-like
risk.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"On a current accident year basis excluding cats the combined ratio was 89.5% and excluding ag it
was 88.3% up modestly like 0.4% from prior year.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Book and tangible book value per share were up
2% and 3.3% respectively in the quarter and are up 9.8% and 15.7% since December 31 driven by a
combination of strong income and the mark from falling interest rates.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"While benefiting temporarily our
company's book value growth prolonged low interest rates a result of over-alliance on monetary policy
have penalized savers and led to misallocation of capital and overvaluation of assets without substantially
supporting business investment and economic growth.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

CHUBB LIMITED FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 30 2019
Annualized core operating return on equity for the quarter was 9.5%.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Phil will have more to say about
investment income book value cats and prior period development.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
Turning to growth and the rate environment.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"P&C premium revenue in the quarter in constant dollars was
quite strong.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
Net premiums grew 7.2% and then foreign exchange had a 1 point negative impact.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"As I noted at the beginning the pricing environment continued to improve quarter-on-quarter with the
rate of increase accelerating and spreading to more classes of business and risk type.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"For perspective rate
increases in both our North America commercial lines and on our London wholesale businesses this quarter
were double those of the first quarter 6.4% versus 3.2% and 17% versus 8% respectively.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
In the U.S. rates continued to firm in major accounts E&S wholesale specialty and the middle market.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"In our international operations we continue to observe firming conditions in the London wholesale
market and in Australia while rates began to increase in the U.K. retail market and parts of the continent
particularly for large risks.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The market is responding to the fact that rates have not kept pace with loss
costs over a number of years which has put pressure on margins and ultimately on reserves.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
Rates have gone down while loss costs have risen.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
Pretty simple math.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"However as we have been saying
for some time the frequency of severity and certain long-tail and short-tail classes has been worsening
while at the same time in other classes it has remained subdued or declined.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
For the sake of simplicity let's divide long-tail loss into 3 buckets.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Bucket 1 generally speaking in the
attritional loss layers severity has been increasing at a relatively modest pace and frequency has been
steady though there are exceptions.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"In the second bucket in excess layers the frequency of large claims settlements has been increasing
and putting pressure on rate adequacy a consequence of so-called social inflation but also casualty
attachment points not moving for years.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"A $1 million attachment point for casualty excess 10 years ago is
worth a fraction of the amount today.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
And finally the third bucket.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"There has been an increase in class actions large to mega everything from
securities and antitrust related to science-based.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"For example chemical pharma and physical trauma
related.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And there are casualty cat-type events such as molestation-related reviver statues legislative
actions.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
I have spoken about all of this for some time now.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"In my judgment given the simple math the risk
environment and a reset of risk appetite on the part of many the current market conditions are
sustainable.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
Returning to the quarter.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Overall prices increased in North America commercial on a written basis by 6.8%
versus a loss cost trend of about 4.5%.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Renewal price change includes both rate of 6.4% and exposure
change of 0.4%.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"As I noted last quarter we are also benefiting from a flight to quality particularly in large account and
specialty as more business meets our underwriting standards.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Given the choice many potential customers
prefer Chubb.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"New business in North America Commercial Lines was up 18.5% in the quarter with major accounts in
Specialty up over 23% and middle market and small commercial up over 9.5%.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Retention of our customers remained very strong across all of our North America Commercial and
Personal P&C businesses with renewal retention as measured by premium of 96.6%.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"In major accounts and specialty commercial excluding agriculture premiums were up 9.5% with major
accounts retail up about 5.5% and E&S wholesale up over 18%.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Rates for major accounts were up over
8% with risk management up 4.5% excess casualty up 17.5% and property up over 29%.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Public D&O
rates increased over 17.5%.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"In our E&S wholesale business rates were up about 7.5% with property up 17% and Financial Lines up
8.5%.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

adjusting for the expanded reinsurance that we have discussed in the past net premiums written were
up almost 4% our best quarter of the year.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Retention remains strong at 97% on a premium basis and
steady at over 90% on a policy basis.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

"John Keogh John Lupica and Paul Krump can provide further color on the quarter including current market
conditions and pricing trends.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
In closing this is a very good quarter for Chubb.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

more business met our underwriting standards and we continue to achieve greater price adequacy in an
improving underwriting environment.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

Congratulations on the quarter everyone.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"I was hoping you could touch a little bit more on your
comments on the tort environment which I found very interesting.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And specifically I'm curious if the
buckets and descriptions you're using are just attributed to the U.S.?",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Or given you're international

That's a good question.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The -- when it comes to securities related -- and we don't see it in general
casualty.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
General casualty is behaving in a steady way.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We don't see the same factors that we see now

"There you see the
same trends and in a place like Australia it's even more acute.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"But that's been for some time and I've
been talking about it for a while because it's the same -- we've observed the trends for the last couple of
years.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
The U.K. has worsened over the last 2 years maybe 3.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Australia has been -- it began deteriorating
about 4 years ago and accelerated and is just a stupid environment now.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

"Over the last year in particular though it began 2 years ago but really it's
been the last year we've been reshaping the portfolio.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Given the underwriting environment and the level
of rate we can charge we've been -- we've aggressively pursued more rate increase so that earns into
the portfolio and has a benefit and we've reshaped the portfolio around the margin and that continues

There's nice subrogation that should be coming through there.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"What are your kind of thoughts on
that subrogation when can you potentially see some of that come through?",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
I'm not going to speculate on that.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

No no no.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
I don't think anyone got to it.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
But yes I guess there was a little bit of a higher loss pick there.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
I mean I guess first of all what does that incorporate?,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"How much development could we potentially
expect on that in the fourth quarter?",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And what are you still thinking a good combine ratio use for that
business is when you look out to 2020 or just I guess normalized annual combined ratio for the overall
crop segment?",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
I'll just take that last part.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We've run in the in the high 80s to 90% historically and we don't see a change
to that.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And by the way look at the last number of years we had excellent results the last few years in
that business.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
It has a natural volatility it's crops it has both an attritional and a cat-like nature to it.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And
this year we're going to have a less-than-average year for that business and let me turn it over to John
Lupica for a minute to give you a little more color on that.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"John Joseph Lupica
Vice Chairman and President of North America Major Accounts & Specialty Insurance
Yes.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
Thanks Evan and Ryan too.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We certainly adjusted the year-to-date numbers in the quarter based
on what we know today.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And we still have to capture all of the yields from the field before we can really
put a final number.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The nice part about the year is prices are pretty much at base prices we finish out the
October harvest price schedule.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"So due to the delay in planting the harvest period has been pushed out 5
to 6 weeks.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
So I think by the end of the year we'll obviously have a better sense of the year.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And as Evan
noted if we don't see any change off our expectation we certainly expect it to be in that low 90s area.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Low 90s combined for the fourth quarter would be about where we would imagine if nothing changes from

For Chubb that's not a growth area at this time.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We -- it has -- loss cost trends have been quite benign
and the industry has responded with a lot of competition and lowering the prices some of it rational
some of it to us just beginning to overshoot that mark.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And loss -- the benign loss cost environment it's
questionable whether that will remain.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And so we have been -- as rates have been coming down we have
been exerting more discipline in that area.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
It has not been a growth area for us.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And I'm speaking about
first dollar primary risk transfer business.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
In our risk management business that's a whole different book.,2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And that's where the -- that's large account where it's self-insured or self-funded on some basis and we
provide all kinds of services and we provide excess coverage.",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And there we're -- that's an area that we're

we charge a proper price for taking the risk?",2019-9-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

"Improving severity trends across workers' compensation Small Commercial's package business and
Personal Lines auto all drove favorable reserve releases.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

strengthening in commercial auto liability and general liability driven by some large loss activity.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"As Chris has already mentioned there's been a fair amount of commentary during the quarter regarding
social inflation and we're certainly not immune to these unfavorable tort trends.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"However keep in mind
our Hartford book is made up primarily of smaller customers with lower limit profiles.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"In addition the
adverse development cover we purchased on the Navigators loss development provides another layer of

property results.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
I'm encouraged by the pricing environment in the quarter.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

flat to prior year due to renewal written pricing decreases in workers' compensation and the completion of
the new business rollover from the Foremost renewal rights transaction.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

premium growth was up a very strong 13% for the quarter driven by workers' compensation and package

Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And the first question we have will come from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
First off Beth I do appreciate the new kind of streamlined disclosure within the press release.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"That was
helpful this quarter.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
My first question for you is on capital.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Just following up on some of your prepared
remarks.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"It seems like you guys got the majority of the tax attributes you were expecting this year as of
the end of the third quarter just looking at the 10-Q disclosure.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So I just kind of wanted to walk through
that and get a sense of share repurchases for the fourth quarter.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And then for next year on the capital
side is -- could you just give us a sense of the dividends you could upstream from the P&C subs in 2020
and also if there's any change in the tax attributes you expect as well?",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Beth Costello
Executive VP & CFO
Sure.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
So first of all thank you for the comment on the press release.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"I'm glad that you like the new
format.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So yes as it relates to holding company cash I would say overall we're on track with what we
expected at the beginning of the year.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Yes the timing of the tax benefit we received from our AMT refund
did come in a little bit earlier than we anticipated but we were anticipating that this year.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So we took all
of that into consideration as we have projected kind of our view of share repurchases over the course of
this year and into next year.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And we continue to target for this year about a total of $200 million in share
repurchases and then the remainder of our $1 billion authorization would be used in 2020.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"As it relates to then dividend streams as we go into 2020 again as a reminder we did not take any net
dividends from P&C in 2019 but we do anticipate going back to our normal cadence in 2020.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And as we've
talked about in the past we see dividends sort of in the $850 million to $900 million range.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Obviously
it will depend on actual results.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"From our Group Benefits business we're typically in the $300 million
to $350 million range.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Obviously results in Group Benefits have been very strong so we've seen some
increases in those dividends through the years.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And then Mutual Funds usually is in that $100 million
to $125 million.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And then we do still have some remaining tax benefits that we'd expect to receive in
2020.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So when we look at 2019 we're probably a little bit over $700 million in tax benefits that will come
through.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
And as we look to 2020 we'd be just slightly under $600 million.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So again very much in line
with what we have laid out previously.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And then again I'll just remind you as I said in my prepared remarks we do still anticipate paying our
maturing debt of $500 million in March of 2020.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
That's very helpful.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
And then my second question.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"If we want to kind of keep track of how Navigators is
trending you guys highlighted some earnings projections for that business going a couple of years out.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So just trying to get a sense can you kind of set the stage or give us a sense how much earnings came
through in the quarter?",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Or is the best way for us just to really look at the Global Specialty margins to get
a sense of how Navigators is tracking?",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Elyse thank you for your question.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"I would say what we've commented upon in the past as far as our
goals related to the financial performance of Navigators are really unchanged.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"I think we did say that the
slope of it might be slightly different the components might be slightly different but we still see a path
to earning $200 million of core earnings prior to amortization of intangibles in that 4- to 5-year period of

time and still excited.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
Obviously there's a lot of rate being taken in the specialty space broadly defined.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
But Doug that's what I would say over the long term.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
But what would you say in the near term?,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Just to add that this quarter we made very few adjustments to the prior Navigators loss ratios across their
lines either prior year or in the current accident year.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
We tweaked auto liability slightly in the quarter.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"But
other than that Beth it was a pretty quiet quarter relative to actuarial assumptions.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
Okay.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
And then can you give us a sense of the rate that you're getting just within their book of business?,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Yes.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
I mentioned in my commentary Elyse that it was double digits.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And in the quarter essentially the
U.S. book was right on top of 10.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
Internationally they were getting closer to 16.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And when you put the 2
together we're talking 12-ish 11 to 12 points of price.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
I also said that it was accelerating in the quarter.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
So we're quite pleased about that as you think about the run rate July through September.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And an early
peak of October keeps me optimistic.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
October looks a lot like September.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
So I think we're off to a really good start.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
I'm very pleased with the progress.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"I know Vince and his team
working hard to change the outcomes here.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Operator
Next we have Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Jon Paul Newsome
Sandler O'Neill + Partners L.P. Research Division
I was hoping you could weigh in a little bit more on some of the auto trends that we've seen at other
companies.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Both the commercial auto trend and the severity and frequency seems to be a little bit
different by company and kind of how you vary that what your experiences have and sort of what you
think is behind it.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And then a sort of second question just flip over to the private passenger and ask kind of the same
questions about frequency and severity.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Allstate saw a little bit of a spike in their frequency for physical
damage and I don't know if you've seen the same thing.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
Anyway those are my -- essentially my 2 questions.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Paul let me just clarify.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Personal and Commercial both do you want me to go...
Jon Paul Newsome
Sandler O'Neill + Partners L.P. Research Division
Yes both.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Okay.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
Let's start with Personal.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"We continue to be pleased by the trends we see in our Personal Lines auto
book.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
Frequency has been in good shape for several quarters now.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And severity we're mindful of collision
severity.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"But essentially our loss trends are within our expectations and feel good about progress and
overall performance of the Personal Lines auto line.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC. FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  NOV 05 2019
In Commercial a bit of a different story in the sense that our Small Commercial book much smaller
vehicle.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
We've been working rate now for 5 to 6 years.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
We have transformed that book.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"We're essentially
not a monoline player except in certain circumstances.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Improvement there but more improvement
necessary in the commercial auto Small Commercial space.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
In the middle -- again this is not a specialty auto sector.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"This is essentially commercial auto fleets
attached to our Middle Market accounts.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
Slightly heavier than Small Commercial.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"We also have been
chasing rate here over the last 6 to 7 years.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"We've made progress but not at all acceptable relative to our
operating performance in the line today.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
So we continue to make underwriting adjustments.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"We'll continue
to work hard on rate.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
Very pleased that our rate was up over 10 points in Q3 in auto.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"We'll continue to
work at that in Q4 and into 2020.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"When I think about loss trend they look to us like they're in the mid-single digits maybe plus a little bit
in that 5 to 6 6.5 range commercial auto.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"We're mindful of that which means our pricing needs to be on
top of that plus some to make appreciable progress in combined ratio.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
Chris or Beth anything?,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Jon Paul Newsome
Sandler O'Neill + Partners L.P. Research Division
Do you have any particular theory about the commercial business that might be different from other folks
about why we're seeing the severity trend and whether or not it's accelerating?",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
I would just offer that our book of business on the commercial side ex Nav is largely primary auto.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So
we're not a significant player in the excess space.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"I do think the excess layers have had some pressure
over the past 3 4 years.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
Navigators has a specialty auto book.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
We're very mindful of that.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"We're working
closely with them sharing our trends working actuarial assumptions et cetera and taking quite a bit
of rate there.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
So our rate change in the Navigator auto book is substantial.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"But I don't have any greater
insight because I don't have insight into other competitor books like I do our own.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Operator
Next we have Brian Meredith of UBS.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
A couple of quick ones here.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"First I'm just curious in the Commercial Lines segment the expense ratio
declined year-over-year only around 17% growth in G&A expenses.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"I was expecting it to be a little bit
higher than that.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
Was there anything unusual there?,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Is that a decent run rate with respect to kind of G&A
expense growth and what we're seeing with the expense ratio?",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Yes.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
Good question Brian.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And there are some things happening in both Q2 and Q3 that make that
compare a little bit challenging.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
So let me do my best to unpack it.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"In Q3 quarter we actually had some
credits that ran through from taxes licenses and fees and also some bad debt credits.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And when you kind
of laser them in you basically get a quarterly expense ratio more like 34.5.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
In Q2 we had some one-timers that put some upward pressure on the expense.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And I'd also point out to
you as the Navigators book comes into our expense ratios as a typical specialty company sometimes has
they've got slightly higher expense base.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So between their U.S. and certainly their international there's a
little bit of inflation on the expense coming in from Nav that we will work our way through over the next
couple of years as we earn our way toward those profit targets we've talked about.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So I look at the run rate Q3 more in the 34.5 range and I think that's kind of where we'll be Q4 as I look
out.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

Great.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And then my second question in the Small Commercial area I mean you talked about how it's
a little bit more insulated from the social inflation environment given the kind of limits profile of that
business.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"I'm curious have you seen any increasing competition in that area as a result of what's going on
in the loss cost inflation environment?",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Christopher Jerome Swift

Brian as Doug -- he'll respond too.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"I would say again across many of our businesses there is always
competitive pressure.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
There's new entrants.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"There's fintech-related or insurtech-related activities but I
wouldn't say it's rapidly changing in a more competitive environment where everyone is piling in.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"I would
say -- and you've heard us talk about this before we have a 30-year history here with a lot of data a
lot of capabilities a lot of deep trusted agent relationships that does provide an element of advantage to
us.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"But we're really tuned in on the emerging trends and our own mindset of what do we need to do to
continue to get better every day what do we need to do to continue to differentiate ourselves as one of
the top go-to market.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
So that's our mindset.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
And Doug if you would add anything?,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Yes.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So maybe just a couple of comments about our new Spectrum and then comments on what we've
been working on the last couple of years.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
So very excited Brian about this launch of next-gen Spectrum.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"We've been kind of in the design and building stage for a couple of years now and I think it's going to be
a terrific product in the market much in the way the digital experiences that we're all used to are now
personalized.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Because of that launch we've been laser-focused these last couple of years to get our rate
adequacies on our Spectrum product where they need to be because it's very difficult if you're profit-
challenged in the current line and then go to launch new product.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So as we think about loss trends over these last couple of years we've continued to make sure we're on
top of those trends with pricing.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"We see liability trends in that Spectrum area still in the mid-single digits
and our pricing has been matching that over time and we feel good about our balance sheet in terms of
the reserves that are recorded on our ledger.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
So yes we've been very focused on loss trends here.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

good progress and now exciting that we launch our new effort into the latter half of 2019 into 2020.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

"Jamminder Singh Bhullar
JP Morgan Chase & Co Research Division
I have a couple of questions for Doug.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And first on Commercial Lines how do you think about your
ability to take advantage of improving pricing in the overall market especially given that you've got a big
exposure to workers' comp where prices are actually obviously under pressure?",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Well we're optimistic that our nonworkers' compensation pricing continues to improve.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"As I suggested
that certainly was the case in Q3 and I expect that to continue into Q4.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Yes we recognize we have some
headwinds on the workers' comp environment.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"I would again point out the profitability of those books
is excellent particularly Small Commercial.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So we're mindful of those headwinds and navigating in the
middle account by account and being thoughtful about class selection and state and geography in Small
Commercial.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So yes it is a tale of 2 where we're working hard to improve our core pricing while we understand is a
very competitive workers' comp dynamic that matters greatly to us.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

And then on Personal Lines I think you would hope that at some point over the next few quarters you'll
start to see stabilizing premiums and maybe an improvement in premiums.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"But it seems like more and
more companies are sort of shifting their focus from revolving margins to accelerating growth.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

comments on competition whether it's still rational and your expectation of when you can sort of get to
flat to positive premium growth in that market.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

Chairman & CEO
Jimmy obviously we're not going to give any guidance or specific drivers but the overall focus as both
Doug and I have commented upon has been growth orientation but you are right.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"I mean it's a dynamic
marketplace just because we want to grow and there's a lot of other competitors that are shifting to that
same mindset.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
So the trick in that environment at least in my judgment is you got to remain disciplined.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

it seems like over the past call it half decade we've been talking about commercial auto reserve
development and it feels like we've been talking about it probably more at Hartford than a lot of
competitors.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

Ryan thanks.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Let's just start on the quarter and then I do want to comment because I think you're
onto something relative to the prior trend.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So in this quarter we made an adjustment to our prior year
development based on some large losses we had seen in our National Account book.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So it's largely
National Accounts I would say almost all National Accounts.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
80% of the change is National Accounts.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"And
it's something that we had not adjusted in the last several years.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
So really exclusively our national book.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
If you go back over 5 to 6 years correctly stated we have been adjusting auto.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"I would say back in the
'12 '13 time period we had a broader specialty auto book transportation vehicles that caused some
of the adjustment and actually raised our attention to this commercial auto dynamic that we've been
working hard on for 5 or 6 years.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
So I would agree with you.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

we've provided enough data to say that there were a couple of one-timers in this quarter.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So I look at it
that the quarter was roughly more in line with that $120 million earnings at an 8% margin but clearly
above our long-term views that we've guided to which is still 6% to 7%.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"I think the thing that you just have to keep in mind is a lot of the results that are emerging today are
based on pricing and commitments we've made 2 3 years ago that are just outperforming.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"So unlike P&C
we generally make 3-year rate guarantees.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"We're very thoughtful and disciplined in making those 3-year
rate guarantees because that's the commitment.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

any one pocket but largely across our Middle Market book of business.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"Construction included a little bit

"So that really is the basis for the tweaking we did in the quarter for
general liability.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
"In a broader sense as we think about loss trends overall our loss trends are somewhere in that mid-
single-digit range when you combine all our lines and I'm thinking primarily about auto liability and
GL which are the 2 lines that really form the basis for most of your questions.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

between small and middle and some of our specialty lines with the specialty -- Global Specialty book

"You might
have an account or 2 or a new business opportunity where someone does something more aggressive but
generally competitive but balanced.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt
I would say that the year-over-year numbers that you're looking at does look down.,2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

adjust for the New York Family Paid Leave product that launched in '18 you really have sort of a $40

"So really you can consider it slightly
down to flattish.",2019-9-30 The Hartford Transcipt.txt

"We do still get
some contribution to sales in that $40 million to $50 million range from Aetna's medical staff that is still

"Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements so please refer to our 10-K for 2019 and other
public documents for information on potential risks.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
And now I'll turn it over to Tom.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Thomas Joseph Wilson
Chairman President & CEO
Good morning.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Thank you for joining us from wherever you are sheltered in place.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Let's jump right in with Allstate's response to the coronavirus pandemic on Slide 2.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Allstate has been helping customers overcome catastrophes for 89 years and we've learned to act decisively quickly
and put customers first.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
As a result we've led the industry in helping customers.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We created a Shelter-in-Place Payback
program of more than $600 million.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Special payment plans are being used for customers experiencing financial
challenges.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Auto insurance coverage was expanded to cover the use of personal vehicles to deliver food medicine and
other goods for commercial purposes.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Allstate Identity Protection is being offered for free for the rest of the year to all U.S.
residents given the increased exposure to cybercrime.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Business continuity plans were executed.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Virtual sales and support capabilities were expanded.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And we leveraged our
digital innovations such as QuickFoto Claim and Virtual Assist to better protect our customers employees and agents.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Employees and Allstate agents moved to more than 95% working remotely and we altered a number of business
practices to support our agents and employees.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
At the same time Allstate is financially strong with significant capital and liquidity.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"In February we reduced our public
equity holdings by $4 billion to reduce the amount of economic capital back in the investment portfolio.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"But this turned out
to be good timing because it enabled us to reduce the impact of the market downturn in March.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And as Mario will cover
later we will maintain our share repurchase program given the strong capital position.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"For our communities the Allstate Foundation announced an additional $5 million that's on top of the money we normally
grant every year which is substantial to help deal with the pandemic and double demand for Allstate employees' need.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Move to Slide 3.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Let's touch base with Allstate's strategy.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"As you know our strategy has 2 components: increase personal
Property-Liability market share and expand into other protection businesses.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"This 2-part strategy leads to our 5 annual
operating priorities which is shown on the right side of this page and we made good progress around all 5.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

THE ALLSTATE CORPORATION FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  MAY 06 2020
If you move to Slide 4 Allstate had strong operating and financial results in the first quarter.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Total revenues of $10.1 billion
declined 8.3% for the prior year quarter due to capital losses instead of capital gains in the prior year.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"If you exclude the
impact of the realized capital losses revenues increased 2% driven by a 4.4% increase in Property-Liability insurance
premiums which you can see from the table.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Net income of $513 million declined to the prior year quarter's increased underwriting income was more than offset by
capital losses and charges for pension and postretirement benefits.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Adjusted net income shown in the middle of the table was $1.1 billion in the quarter or $3.54 per diluted share which
was significantly above the prior year reflecting lower catastrophe losses.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Returns were excellent with adjusted net
income return on equity improving to 18.2%.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Mario will now discuss the first quarter results in more detail.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Mario Rizzo
Executive VP & CFO
Thanks Tom and good morning everybody.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Let's go to Slide 5 to discuss the strong performance of our Property-Liability segment.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Starting with the chart on the left
policy and premium growth continued with excellent recorded and underlying profitability.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Underwriting income of $1.35
billion in the first quarter was $645 million higher than the prior year quarter with a combined ratio of 84.9.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"The improvement to prior year was driven by several factors including lower catastrophe losses increased premiums
earned and lower auto accident frequency from the decline in miles driven.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Auto accident frequency was significantly
lower in the quarter with property damage gross frequency down 12% compared to the prior year quarter.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"For the
month of March property damage gross frequency declined 27% compared to the prior year as miles driven dropped
significantly as states began implementing social distancing measures.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"These benefits were partially offset by increased
severity and the Shelter-in-Place Payback expense.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"The chart on the right shows our Property-Liability expense ratio over time and specifically highlights the $210 million
Shelter-in-Place Payback expense we recorded in the first quarter which increased the expense ratio by 2.4 points.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Excluding this impact the expense ratio improved by 1 point compared to the prior year quarter reflecting continued
progress on enhancing the customer value proposition which is one of the key components of our Transformative Growth
Plan.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Let's go to Slide 6 which highlights investment performance for the first quarter.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"As you'd expect our first quarter
investment portfolio results reflect the impact of the market volatility caused by the coronavirus.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"As shown in the table in
the middle of the page total return for the first quarter was a negative 2.4% largely reflecting lower portfolio valuation.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"While the decline in treasury rates supported fixed income prices the significant widening of credit spreads more
than offset that benefit and interest-bearing valuation decline reduced return by 1.9%.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Lower equity valuations further
decreased returns by another 1%.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
The chart shows net investment income of $421 million in the quarter which was $227 million lower than the prior year.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
We recorded a loss of $208 million for performance-based results in the first quarter as shown in gray.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"As you may recall
the income on our limited partnership is typically booked on a 1-quarter lag.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Performance-based income related to fourth quarter 2019 sponsored financial statement was $176 million.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We also
recorded write-downs of $137 million on 4 underperforming private equity investments.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"In a typical quarter this is where
our process would have ended.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"However given market volatility and economic disruption we also recognized declines in
the value of limited partnership interest where we had enough information to make informed estimates rather than solely
relying on sponsored financial statement as of December 31.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"This included updating publicly traded investments held
within limited partnership to their March 31 market pricing which reduced investment income by $52 million.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We also did not recognize $195 million of unrealized valuation increases reported in sponsor's fourth quarter financial
statements.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
The sum total of these 4 items generated the $208 million performance-based loss in Q1.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Because these
investments exhibit idiosyncratic risk and return future gains and losses are uncertain.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"But we believe utilizing this
approach in the quarter is a better indication of current value.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

Income from the market-based portfolio shown in blue was lower than the prior year quarter by $19 million reflecting
the impact of lower reinvestment rates.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We expect this trend to continue to the extent reinvestment rates remain below
average interest-bearing portfolio yield.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Let's turn to Slide 7 to discuss our portfolio positioning.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We take a disciplined and proactive approach to managing the
investment portfolio risk and return profile and our positioning has mitigated the impact of the current crisis.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"As you
can see in the chart on the left of the page the portfolio is largely made up of high-quality fixed income securities with
substantial liquidity.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We extended the duration of our Property-Liability portfolio last year which was support -- which
has supported both income and returns in the lower-rate environment.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We are conservatively positioned in sectors
more susceptible to the pandemic and continue to monitor those exposures closely.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"To provide transparency into these
exposures we have enhanced our Form 10-Q disclosures.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We also have a 13% allocation to performance-based investments and public equity securities down from 18% at year-
end 2019 which backed long-dated liabilities and capital.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"As you can see in the chart at the bottom right in February we
reduced our equity exposure by $4 billion primarily through the sale of public equity securities with proceeds invested in
high-quality fixed income.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"These trades were executed at an average price equivalent of 3281 on the S&P 500 compared
to the March month end level of 2585.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We continue to proactively employ a disciplined risk-and-return framework to the
portfolio as economic conditions evolve.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review results for the Life Benefits and Annuities segment.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Allstate Life shown on the left
generated adjusted net income of $80 million in the first quarter an increase of $7 million compared to the prior year
quarter driven by lower operating costs and expenses.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Allstate Benefits' adjusted net income of $24 million in the first
quarter was $7 million below the prior year quarter.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"The decline was due to higher operating costs and expenses driven
by increased investments in technology and higher DAC amortization.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Allstate Annuities shown on the bottom right had an adjusted net loss of $139 million in the first quarter primarily due to
the performance-based investment results we discussed earlier.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Coronavirus claims did not appear to materially impact any of these businesses in the first quarter though we continue to
monitor developments closely.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Now let's turn to Slide 9 to talk about our Service Businesses.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"The Service Businesses continued to increase the number
of customers protected with policy in-force growth of 35.4% to 113.7 million.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"This is largely due to the increase in Allstate
Protection Plans.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Revenues excluding the impact of realized gains and losses grew 18.2% to $454 million in the first quarter.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Adjusted net income improved to $37 million in the first quarter reflecting an increase of $26 million compared to the first
quarter of 2019 driven by growth of Allstate Protection Plans and improved profitability at Allstate Roadside Services.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Slide 10 highlights Allstate's attractive returns and strong capital position.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"While the impact of the coronavirus drove
financial market instability and led to a decline in shareholders' equity Allstate's diversified business model substantial
earnings capacity and strong capital and liquidity enables us to manage effectively through this pandemic.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We have $3.4
billion in parent company holding deployable assets and $8.8 billion of highly liquid securities saleable within 1 week.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We continued to generate strong returns on capital with an adjusted net income return on equity of 18.2% as of the end
of the first quarter while returning $670 million to common shareholders in the quarter through a combination of $511
million in share repurchases and $159 million in common stock dividends.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We plan to continue share repurchases under
our current $3 billion program which is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And now I'll turn it over to Glenn to discuss the coronavirus impact on auto insurance and how we're leveraging data and
insights to make decisions.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Glenn Thomas Shapiro
President of Personal Property-Liability of AIC
Thanks Mario and good morning everyone.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Let's go to Slide 11 which looks at the potential impacts of coronavirus on
auto insurance.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Profit has been and will be impacted by a reduction in miles driven which will lower overall loss costs.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
While this has been significant it will decline over time as the economy begins to reopen and there are several offsets.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

First the reduction of drivers on the road has increased driving speeds which can lead to increased severity per claim.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
We'll also likely incur additional bad debt from some customers who have chosen to take extended payment terms.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"On a longer-term basis if the global auto parts supply chain is disrupted or parts prices are raised by auto manufacturers
this could increase repair costs.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
The pandemic and economic slowdown will also impact growth.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"If loss costs continue to
be below prior year the lower required rate increases will limit average premium growth.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
On the positive side the Shelter-in-Place payment could have a favorable impact on retention.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"The impact on new business is unclear since reduced vehicle sales can lower new business but economic conditions
may increase shopping levels.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And we've seen an increased customer interest in telematics and we're well positioned
with both Drivewise and Milewise the latter of which charges customers' insurance by mile.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Getting ahead of these trends
will be important to grow profitably as we continue to manage profitability and competitive position on a market-by-market
basis and will enable us to be precise in our responses.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Let's now move to Slide 12.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"As a customer of Arity we have access not only to our data but insights from a much broader
data set some of which is shown on this slide.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Telematics-based pricing allows you to factor in things like how much
someone drives where they drive and how they drive.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Our telematics products enable us to do that for individual customers which when combined with a broader set of data
enables us to make better judgments market by market.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"For example based on 3.5 billion trips from February through April the upper-left graph shows that miles driven declined
sharply in mid-March and then began a slow increase since then.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"You can also see that those states that had stay-at-
home orders had a bigger decline in driving.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"In the upper right you can see there's also a difference between rural areas at the top of the chart which declined by
about 20% and urban areas at the bottom which declined by about 50%.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"The bottom-left graph shows that while some
drivers are not driving at all those are the bars to the left about 20% of drivers are actually driving more than they did
before mid-March.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Arity also provides a Drivesight score which is a measure of driving risk.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
The lower the score the higher the risk.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"As you
can see on the bottom right the mean risk has increased despite fewer cars on the road which correlates to the data
that shows some drivers are driving faster.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"The net of all of this is that Allstate has the data and business processes to
proactively adjust to a changing operating environment.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
I'll now pass it back to Tom.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

First question will be on the expense ratio the underlying expense ratio improvement.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Can you talk about what -- and you
provided just a basic comment on it in your prepared remarks.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

Mario why don't you take expenses?",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
And Glenn will you take the agent?,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Mario Rizzo
Executive VP & CFO
Yes sure.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"So when you look at the expense ratio in the quarter you saw a 1 point sequential decline year-over-year in the
expense ratio.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
And first thing I'd say is reducing our cost continues to be a core part of our transformative growth strategy.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And when you kind of deconstruct where the improvement came from it's about 50-50 not quite between acquisition
costs and operating costs.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
And obviously those are 2 core parts of our cost structure and we saw improvement in both.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And we're going to continue
to be focused on reducing those costs going forward to enhance our competitive position to still take growth and be a core
part of transformative growth for us.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We're also going to continue to invest in the things we need to invest in for transformative growth things like technology
and marketing.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
But we're focused going forward on continuing to reduce costs over time.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
I'll turn it over to Glenn to talk a little bit about the agency part of it.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"Glenn Thomas Shapiro
President of Personal Property-Liability of AIC
Yes.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
Greg thanks for the question.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"In terms of the LSP count and agent count you hit on part of it in your question with
integrated service.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"When you look at licensed sales professionals and in spite of the word sales being the operative word
there they spend only about 40% of their time on sales about 60% on service.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
That's been a historic number.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And one of the things we're committed to is taking a lot of the transactional work out both through self-service capabilities
as well as integrated service over time so that they're increasing that percentage of time they're selling and not having
to do as much of that transactional work.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
So we'll probably see that change over time.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And that's really part of our overall
transformative growth work that we're doing.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And in terms of the agency count we're really focused on growth and growing with quality in terms of the agency
force.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"So coming into this year I think everybody knew we changed compensation a little bit where we moved variable
compensation from renewal to new part of it.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

brilliance of your decision to sell the public equities in February.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

"But as I look at the adjustments you made to
the limited partnerships do you think that this is a permanent change to your valuation approach on a quarterly basis?",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

-- and I guess the other adjacent question was -- would be that in your adjustments to the first quarter results on LPs did
it include an assessment for all of the LPs or 100% of the portfolio?",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

"Mario Rizzo
Executive VP & CFO
Sure Tom.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"So Greg I guess where I'd start is as we've said in the past generally we record performance-based income
on a 1-quarter lag based on the partner financial statements as of the prior quarter end.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"So for example in the first
quarter we would have relied on year-end partner financial statements.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And that's typically how we would approach the
accounting.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"However our accounting policy does require that when a material market event occurs and we have information available
to make informed estimates that we need to take that information into account.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
And that's what we did this quarter.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"So we
made the 2 adjustments the -- marking the public equity holdings in some of the partnership holdings to March 31 levels
and then suppressing the increases in unrealized valuation on securities that were reflected in the year-end financial
statement.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"We did that because that's part of the accounting policy because there was a material market event in the
quarter.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
The other piece was the -- just our normal watchlist process where we go through every holding.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And to the extent we
believe we need to impair a holding we do that.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
And that was worth $137 million in the quarter on 4 specific holdings.,2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"So
absent another market disruption event let's say hopefully we avoid one this quarter we'll go back to what our typical
process would be.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"But because there was this disruption event in the first quarter our policy required that if we had
additional information that we could make good estimates based on we should do that.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

the course of the last 6 weeks almost all of our agents have called almost all of their customers.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

unique period of time where a people are more available to be reached; b they have more questions and they really
want to hear from their trusted adviser; and c our folks are just committed to that because of a national crisis.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"And so I think that there's this moment in time where at least some portion of our customer base will really see the value
of what they've gotten out of their agency relationship and having a trusted adviser.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt
"That said everything Mario and Tom
and others have talked about on this call about transformative growth is we've got to keep taking costs out of our system

of a pay-per-mile product and we're seeing a nice uptick in the demand for it.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

over-demand for something like Milewise is going up.",2020-03-31 Allstate Transcript.txt

for all of us.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
This crisis has been heartbreaking to witness as it unfolds across the globe.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"It's a tough time for everyone and the

believe AIG will emerge from COVID-19 stronger and more unified with greater perspective wisdom and gratitude.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

momentum we had as we moved into 2020 which continued through the first quarter of this year.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
While not easy we took a very prudent yet robust approach to analyzing COVID-19 impact across AIG.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"This is a very
unique catastrophe and we will continue to be thoughtful and thorough as we move through each quarter while this
ongoing event evolves.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

2020.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

greater demand when COVID-19 begins to stabilize.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

effects of volatile markets we do not believe that the impact of COVID-19 will result in a material reduction of our long-

Thank you Brian.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Today I plan to review the following topics:
a brief overview of the potential near- and longer-term impact of COVID-19 on the insurance and reinsurance markets
generally; how we analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on GI through March 31; first quarter results for General Insurance
excluding COVID-19 including Validus Re our recently announced launch of Syndicate 2019 and AIG 200; and the
progress that we've made since our last earnings call.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"As Brian said the near- and long-term impact of COVID-19 on the global economy in insurance and reinsurance
industries remains unclear.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"In contrast to other catastrophes like wildfires hurricanes and earthquakes this event is not
confined to any specific geographic region and it had already impacted over 200 countries and territories.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"In addition this
(sic) [ its ] duration is not limited as is typically the case with traditional CATs.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"While the insurance industry manages risk of all kinds it's fair to say that the profound impact and global nature of
COVID-19 is something we have never encountered.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"There's no playbook and as a result we are called upon to make
thoughtful and prudent decisions in a climate of unprecedented uncertainty.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Before COVID the largest catastrophes on record were Hurricane Katrina with $65 billion losses; then the Tohoku
earthquake with $35 billion in loss; Hurricane Irma with $30 billion losses; and Superstorm Sandy also with approximately
$30 billion in losses.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
With respect to COVID-19 we're starting to see early industry estimates but they have significant ranges.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"While it's
too early to gauge the ultimate size of the loss we believe COVID-19 will result in the largest individual CAT loss the
insurance industry has ever seen.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Going forward COVID-related losses will impact all aspects of underwriting insurance
from absolute limits available limits deployed to certain lines of business terms and conditions co-insurance and
structure of coverage just to name a few.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"With respect to the reinsurance market unlike traditional main parallel catastrophes COVID was not modeled and
therefore it will be a headwind for future capacity.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
We believe the retro market will contract.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And in the ILS market there
will be trapped capital which will lock up collateral therefore restricting capacity on a go-forward basis.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And we're already
seeing this.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"At AIG the body of work in General Insurance which started in late 2017 has significantly improved our company's
financial position and has allowed us to take a leadership position in the market.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Our strategic decisions and disciplined
focus on areas such as underwriting excellence the rebalancing of our portfolio improved rate adequacy and the
strengthening of our leadership and underwriting capabilities coupled with the addition of Validus in a comprehensive and
revamped reinsurance program has served us very well and enabled us to preserve capital and provide more predictable
outcomes aligned with our risk tolerance.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"AIG is well positioned to be the insurer that clients turn to for advice on risk and
risk management issues and our partnerships with distribution have continued to strengthen as we problem-solve risk
issues through this challenging time.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Turning to General Insurance.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Before reviewing our first quarter results I'd like to address the loss estimate we booked for
COVID-19.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

attributed common equity of 8.4%.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

significant market stress in March compared with the strong market recovery we saw in the first quarter of 2019.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"The main
driver of the decrease was lower equity market returns which primarily resulted in higher variable annuity reserves of
$161 million and higher deferred acquisition cost amortization DAC of $138 million.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Also widening credit spreads generated lower returns from fair value option bonds of $116 million and the low interest

compression across the whole portfolio of approximately 8 to 16 basis points annually.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

treasury rates to respectively increase or decrease earnings by approximately $5 million to $15 million annually.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

"This portfolio is
about 73% fixed income available-for-sale securities which represents 75% of General Insurance's portfolio and 74% of
Life and Retirement.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"In addition roughly 14% of the portfolio is invested in mortgage and other loans 6% in short-term

"It's important to recognize though that roughly 80% of the FVO fixed income portfolio which historically has had higher
volatility than our available-for-sale fixed maturity securities is held in legacy.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

"First the
success of our hedging program and the second would be Blackboard.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Turning first to our hedging program.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Roughly
$3.6 billion of variable annuity fair value benefits were reflected during the first quarter within the realized gains line as
a direct result of successful interest rate and equity risk hedging within the Life and Retirement and Legacy segments
that clearly preserved book value.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"It should be noted though that on a GAAP basis this gain was aided by the NPA or
nonperformance adjustment impact which is highly volatile and reversible depending upon rate spreads in equity markets.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Secondly at the end of March AIG made a strategic decision to discontinue Blackboard our internal insurance tech start-
up in light of current market condition.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Blackboard's GOE which was $16 million in the quarter has been historically
recorded in other operations but that will cease starting with the second quarter of this year.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Associated with this business
decision we recorded an approximate $165 million after-tax charge not included in APTI.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Pivoting to AIG 200.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
As Peter noted we continue to refine our operational plans in response to COVID-19.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

that this strategic 3-year transformation will result in $1.3 billion in costs to achieve an annualized $1 billion of run rate

"Let me first just provide a quick review and then I'll give you the AIG 200 3-year walk as well as its impact on the first
quarter of 2020.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"From a reporting perspective all costs to achieve aside from $400 million of pretax spending that will be
capitalized will be recorded below the line not in APTI as restructuring and other costs which will make it straightforward
to track.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"These below-the-line charges mostly involve employee-related costs dedicated internal resources and
associated professional services (sic) [ fees ].",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Capitalized costs of $400 million before tax represent mostly investments in systems development interfaces data
conversions and associated integrated workflow processes which have an impact on cash but are not expensed
immediately in the income statement.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Instead each investment will be capitalized and then amortized through GOE based
on its useful life according to accounting principles.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Hence by year-end 2022 we would expect that the amortization
portion of the $400 million will be included in our annual expense run rate where our goal is a total annual run rate

"Of these amounts approximately $100 million in
2020 will be capitalized with later amortization into GOE.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"The combination of these 2 results in a below-the-line projected
charge of $250 million before tax.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

"Based on projected completion by year-end 2022 the unamortized balance of about $350 million will

there.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

related to AIG 200 and the balance from other actions.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Going forward restructuring charges will primarily reflect AIG 200
costs.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

annualized run rate basis which is part of the $300 million planned run rate benefit by year-end 2020.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Now shifting to capital management and looking ahead.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"In light of the significant uncertainty on many fronts due to
COVID-19 we do not plan to do additional share repurchases or debt reduction actions for the foreseeable future but we
will reassess this as COVID-19 impact stabilizes.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

result we are considering options to generate additional near-term liquidity in light of ongoing economic volatility as well
as upcoming debt maturities in 2020 and in the medium term.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Although spreads have widened since year-end all-in coupons are attractive.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And given the significant uncertainty around
the duration and depth of global recession created by COVID-19 as well as taking into account our global operating
footprint and different regulatory capital regimes we think it is prudent to evaluate debt capital market opportunities in the
near term rather than waiting until later in the year which was our original plan prior to COVID-19.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Lastly and reflecting back the first quarter benefited in the first 2 months from strong momentum in GI pricing investment

"Elyse Beth Greenspan

policies contain coverage for infectious diseases and that those policies do have small sublimits.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"I'm just trying to get a
sense for those policies where you think you could see losses have you set up reserves within your COVID losses in the
first quarter?",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Brian Charles Duperreault

Okay.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Elyse I think that's a question for Peter.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Peter would you take that please?,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Peter Salvatore Zaffino
President Global COO & CEO of General Insurance
Yes.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Sure Brian.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Elyse let me just give you a little bit more detail.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Yes we did go through it very thoroughly in the first
quarter as I outlined our process that we did bottom-up and top-down.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"But when you look at the size and scope of our
global portfolio the nature of our clients in terms of the segmentation we do have commercial property policy that have
some manuscript wordings.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"As I said in my opening remarks the overwhelming majority of the standard commercial
property policies do contain clear exclusions for viruses and it's fairly standard in the industry.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"These policies also require
that there's direct physical loss or damage that impact the insured business operations.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"As to these policies COVID is not
covered.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
So that's point one.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
There are limited instances where we do write affirmative coverage for communicable diseases.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"But even in those cases
it's only on a supplemented basis and it's pursuant -- we have very strict underwriting guidelines that often result in
coverage for only specified diseases and in an event that there's a requirement that there would also be a government
closure caused by physical presence of the disease itself.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
So again it's fairly clear.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And just to give you some context in terms of what I'm talking about is that 100% of our sublimits aggregate to well less
than 1% of our total limits in our commercial property policy.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
So it's a very small portion of the overall property exposure.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And I would just note that I mentioned in my prepared remarks we have really comprehensive reinsurance whether it's
on a property per risk basis.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"We have low attachment points on a per occurrence basis that's regional and we also have
global aggregates that attach to reduced volatility on a frequency and severity basis.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

offsetting factors.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
In terms of the market effects look there's 2 things.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"I mean when equity markets move particularly when they go down
that ultimately reduces our future expected fee income particularly in the annuities portfolio which we have to reflect
immediately and back.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And the reality is that the reduced reserve overall actually emerges as additional profits in the
future and also serves to increase our SOP 03-1 reserves.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And when changes in credit spreads we see the immediate
impact on fair value options.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"So those 2 short-term market effects are reversible and that leads to the third thing which is pricing and how do we
feel about current pricing.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And certainly treasury rates are at all-time lows but our ability to price product is to pace -- is
based not only on where base rates are but also where credit spreads what is the shape of the yield curve and where
investor expectations and appetites are.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And so based on the current environment we're still able to price to long-term
expectations that we have.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Certainly there's disruptions in the sales environment but it's difficult to anticipate what the
future on that is going to be and how it evolves.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

"Peter Salvatore Zaffino

Yes.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"What happened in international personal lines it's not an anomaly but we basically had a runoff program that
impacted -- and we still had earned premiums.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
So it was put into runoff in 2018 unearned premium in '19.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And as
we've been doing the re-underwriting of the portfolio again not as much as we did on the commercial we've just lost a
little bit of premium.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
And so the ratios look like they -- perhaps they're not going in the right direction.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"But the absolute
performance is very strong.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"We like the personal book very much and think that there are some real discrete opportunities
for growth particularly in A&H and an area across all of international and actually have a new digital platform we're putting
in.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
So I wouldn't read into that in terms of a trend.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

Well Brian I guess my job is to continually always think about the structure that we have.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Does it make sense?,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Would
we be better in a different structure?",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
And so that thinking continues.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"I think at this point we're comfortable with where we
are but that's my job as we continue to do that.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

Any other question Brian?,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Brian Robert Meredith

Yes.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Just one other quick one here.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
I'm just thinking about it.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"So given this is as you were saying the largest catastrophe
loss for the insurance industry probably ever if I kind of think back AIG with KRW had well over $2 billion of losses.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

"There's been a complete
change in how we look at the risk.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"The derisking that we've done the limits management the improved reinsurance

that this is the largest event because I want people to understand that it's creating an inflection point in the industry.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

Andrew Scott Kligerman

what you might expect during the course of the year.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And then with regard to your variable annuity hedging that was very
strong what was your hedging effective numbers with variable annuity?",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And lastly just in terms of the press release and what you said on the call you talked about maintaining the return on
equity profile for the Life business.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
What might that profile be?,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"I mean could you [ run through ] where you think a good
range [ could be ] and where the Life and Retirement business could be?",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Brian Charles Duperreault

Okay.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Andrew thanks.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"So I'm going to have Kevin and obviously talk about the sensitivity around COVID-19 and the
hedging program.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
On the hedging program I think Kevin why don't you do the piece about the variable annuity?,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"But I
would like Doug to jump in on the -- what happened with Fortitude as well.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
So Kevin why don't you start?,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Kevin Timothy Hogan
Executive VP and CEO of Life & Retirement
Yes.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Thanks Brian.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Thanks Andrew.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
So look I guess I'll address that from a couple of perspectives.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"I covered the market
impacts the short-term market impacts so I'm not sure -- I need to go back to that.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"But I mean clearly when equity
markets move it impacts the SOP in the DAC.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
And when the fair values move that impacts the fair value options.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Those
will unwind.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Andrew Scott Kligerman

On [ Life ] I meant simply the mortality…

I'm sorry Andrew?",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Andrew Scott Kligerman
Crédit Suisse AG Research Division
Yes.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
I apologize.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
I needed to be clearer.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"I meant simply the mortality what is your sense just given the mortality…
Kevin Timothy Hogan
Executive VP and CEO of Life & Retirement
Oh mortality.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Fine yes.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
So it's very straightforward that in the first quarter we saw mortality better than pricing.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"We
believe there are delays in the reporting of those claims.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"As we look at second quarter and third quarter based on where
the current estimates are this is well within our first level modeled stress scenario.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"We don't expect any significant
impact on the balance sheet.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And there's also -- it's difficult to project how people are going to behave how people are
going to respond.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
So that's about the best that we can do.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"It's just based on where we believe our market presence and
geographical presence are versus the current expected losses.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
In terms of hedging what I would say is first of all you can only hedge what you have.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And so the liability profile that we
have is a big part of the success of our hedging program because we have primarily derisked benefits sold well after the
VA arms race of the mid-2000s.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"And so that includes our feature of requiring fixed-income allocation volatility control
funds et cetera.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
We've hedged all hedgeable market risks.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"We've left an open position relative to credit spread because
we believe that that is a natural hedge against our general account portfolio.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Over time our hedge effectiveness is around
90% and it's continued to perform almost exactly as we expected in the various market dynamics resulting in I think the
results -- the good results we reported for the quarter.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"But I'm going to pass on to Doug because another feature of our hedging success in the first quarter was also in the
Fortitude portfolio.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

Thank you Kevin.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"So I just wanted to comment on the fact that what you don't really see in the financials is with
respect to the Legacy segment you're seeing all the mark-to-market impact particularly of the fair value option securities
that are in Legacy and to some extent in Fortitude.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"What you don't see is the fact that we had established interest rate
and credit hedges which all that P&L and effect goes through realized capital gains and losses.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"So you don't really see the
net effect.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"But the best way to look at how that -- how the entity performed and how those hedges are formed and how effective they
were is as Mark made in his prepared remarks he said that the regulatory capital ratios for the entity were preserved from
over a year ago.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"So that gives you a sense of how effective our hedging strategy was for things that you're not necessarily

background on what the basis is for this assessment specifically the length of shutdown you're assuming here?",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

are your thoughts on the Willis piece released Friday?",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

paid?",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

"Brian Charles Duperreault
CEO & Director
Okay.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
Well let me start with that and then Peter can add from it.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"But in terms -- just in terms of the payments these
particularly business interruption claims are very long in process and payments.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"So I think we're just -- I think we just
cleaned up the last business interruption from Superstorm [ Irma ] to give you some idea.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
So anyway.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"But in terms of
the estimate I mean we've seen a lot of different estimates and I think they run the range.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"But the first thing you have to
understand is this is global in nature.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
This pandemic has affected every corner of the world.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"It isn't that hard to come up
with a reasonable assumption around the effects because we're seeing effects in Europe we're seeing effects in Japan
we're seeing effects in Latin America and of course here in North America.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"So whether it's the effects of comp that we
talked about or it's the business interruption with travel and event cancellations and on and on and on it doesn't take
much to figure out how this has spread across the globe.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
The question for us is what's our position on all those things?,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
And we feel very very comfortable with how we've managed this risk in general and how we're well positioned for COVID.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"Peter do you want to add anything to that where does the...
Peter Salvatore Zaffino
President Global COO & CEO of General Insurance
Brian not much.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
The only thing I would just add is what you said.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"We've seen a lot of very good written documents that
have come out.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
"But just because of the ongoing nature of the event and the complexity of the different lines of business
it's the wide range of scale in terms of the low end to the high end is about as wide as you'll see in terms of predicting
cash.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt
So it's very hard to pinpoint anything or the level of accuracy until this evolves over time.,2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

again you're saying it's going to exceed Katrina.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

"And again we're not in the business of putting out ranges as to what is going to happen
to the industry because we look at our own portfolio.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

came up with an estimate that exceeded Katrina.",2020-3-31 AIG Transcript.txt

"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman President & CEO
Good morning.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
We're in an unprecedented moment of historic proportions.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"None of us living today has experienced an
event of this nature or magnitude.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
It is at once surreal and catastrophic.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"As a country we will manage through and heal
both our society and economy and it will take time.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The decisive heroic actions taken by our health professionals in
combination with the support and leadership of our federal and state governments and our vast private sector and civil
society are a powerful force to combat the virus stabilize our financial markets support our economy which remains in a
virtual coma and set the stage for recovery.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The most important thing we can do now to achieve stability and health while
reopening the economy is to improve our test digital trace and isolate capability.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
The insurance industry plays an important role in our economic foundation.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"During this health and economic crisis we are
shouldering our responsibilities and carrying our share of the financial load.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"This event impacts both the liability and asset
side of our industry balance sheet.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"With that I'm going to divide my remarks into 2 parts: first our quarterly results which
were very good; then I'll provide some perspective on the current environment and how we are operating.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
To begin as you saw from the numbers we reported core operating income in the first quarter of $2.68 per share.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The quarter was marked by very strong premium revenue growth globally and excellent underwriting results on both a
published and current accident year basis.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The calendar year P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 89.1% versus
89.2% prior year with P&C underwriting income up over 9.5% in constant dollar.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"On a current accident year basis excluding cats the combined ratio was 87.5% a full point improvement over prior year
with current accident year underwriting income up over 18%.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The major difference between calendar year and current
accident year underwriting income growth was a reduced benefit from the runoff of the '19 crop insurance year.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"You'll
recall '19 was a difficult year for agriculture while '18 was an excellent one.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Book and tangible book value per share
declined 5.5% and 7.5% respectively for the quarter.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And Phil will have more to say about investment income book
value cats and prior period development.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Turning to growth in the rate environment.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
P&C net premiums grew 8.9% on a published or 9.3% in constant dollars.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
The commercial P&C pricing environment continued to firm across the globe.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We secured greater market share as we

achieved improved rate to exposure in more lines of business and this necessary firming continued into April.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Overall
rates increased in North America commercial which includes both major accounts and specialty as well as middle
market and small commercial by 10.5%.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"New business was up 27.5% in the quarter and renewal retention was 95% on a
premium basis.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Our North America commercial P&C business had a strong quarter with net premiums growth of over 10%.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"In major
accounts and specialty commercial excluding ag premiums grew about 9.5% with major account retail growth of 7%
and E&S wholesale growth of over 19%.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
In terms of rate increases rates for major accounts were up 13%.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And in
Westchester and Bermuda they were up 16% and 42% respectively.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Turning to our U.S. middle market and small commercial division.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Premiums grew 11% overall with middle market up 9%
and small commercial up over 40%.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Renewal retention in our middle market business was 94.5%.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Middle market pricing
was up over 6.5%.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
And excluding workers' comp it was up over 7%.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"In our North America personal lines business net
premiums written in the quarter were up 4.8% and retention remained very strong at 98% on a premium basis.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"In our international general insurance operations growth remains strong with net premiums written up 10% in constant
dollar and FX then had a negative impact of about 1.3 points.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Net premiums for London wholesale business grew over
27% while our retail division was up over 8.5%.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Growth in our international retail business was led by Latin America
which was up 13%.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Continental Europe and the U.K. had growth of 9.7% and 9.1% respectively.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And overall rates in our
international retail business were up 8% and 18% in our London wholesale.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Our international life insurance business had a strong quarter with net written premiums up nearly 30% in constant dollar.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"John Keogh John Lupica Paul Krump and Juan Luis Ortega can provide further color on the quarter including current
market conditions and pricing trends.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
But that's ancient history and from another time.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"What's important is to recognize the
underlying strength and momentum of our company as we entered this moment.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Turning to the current environment.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The COVID-19 pandemic and consequent economic crisis will of course impact
Chubb.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Our growth momentum particularly in our commercial P&C business globally continued into April and we
continue to experience improved rate to exposure.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"As we go forward offsetting that will be a meaningful impact to growth
from the health and economic crisis as exposures in important areas shrink for a time with the impact varying by country.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"This includes consumer-related lines for example travel insurance A&H discretionary purchases automobile insurance
commercial lines where exposures are reduced while businesses are closed or as they reopen and are diminished or
simply go out of business.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Small commercial businesses in aggregate will be more impacted than medium which will be
more impacted than large companies.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
But it will vary substantially by industry.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"For credit-related products such as trade
credit surety and other lines such as workers' comp premium revenue will be impacted by reduced exposures.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
As you know we do not give forward guidance.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
And in this case the degree of revenue impact is simply unknowable.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"On the other hand as I said we are and will continue to benefit in terms of growth from improved technical conditions as
many insurance companies take actions to reduce exposures or improve their rate to exposure to correct for inadequate
underwriting.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
This will be an earnings event for Chubb.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
It will not threaten our balance sheet.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Operating earnings will be impacted
predominantly on the liability side of the balance sheet from increased insurance claims though the asset side will likely
be impacted as well from increased asset impairments.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"In addition as I just mentioned earnings will be impacted by a
reduction in premium revenues for a period of time.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"In sum from what we know now this will be a manageable cat-like
event.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
However from an exposure we really don't discretely price for.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"So its impact is additive to our normal projected
loss exposure.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
In a sense it's like what terrorism exposure was before 9/11.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
We have a very strong balance sheet.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Our capital and liquidity position are robust and Chubb will continue to operate at
a high level and emerge strong or stronger.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Again insurance has an important role to play in society and in the economy
and we are shouldering our share of responsibility while doing our job to support our employees our customers and our
business partners.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
We have been quite clear about our priorities and it shows in our response.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"First to the extent possible we have taken care of our 33000 people around the world and endeavored to keep them
safe through aggressive work-from-home protocols.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We have provided them a degree of peace of mind knowing their
jobs and benefits are secure during the health crisis with a no-layoff pledge.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Second we have remained consistent in
how we take care of our customers and distribution partners doing what we can to support their needs.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"In fact we are
operating around the globe as a normal company during abnormal times.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt

I am so proud and absolutely grateful for how my colleagues are performing every day as a group.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"From the smallest
to the largest unit from the biggest to the smallest country how each is focused on delivering on our mission from
internal operations to underwriting sales claims marketing and finance it's really quite remarkable.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We're extending
payment terms to commercial customers recognizing their cash flow pressures.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We're providing a premium credit for
auto policyholders in the U.S. recognizing their reduced exposures.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We're supporting our U.S. small business clients with
premium reductions for their reduced exposures.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And we're supporting our small commercial clients by providing health
care workers and first responders with gift cards redeemable at our customers' businesses.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Lastly as a corporate citizen we're contributing to the immediate emergency response today while supporting the future
tomorrow.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Our commitment of $10 million to pandemic relief efforts globally is being directed to a range of organizations
that provide essential resources immediately in areas that are facing the most acute need.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"This includes providing
emergency medical equipment and supplies to health care facilities and helping community food banks support those who
are hungry and vulnerable including so many who've become unemployed as a result of the pandemic.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And this is only
the first chapter.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
As we move into the recovery phase the Chubb Foundation will commit substantial additional funds.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
In sum our company is very strong.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Our balance sheet is in good shape and we are operating well.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"While I see pressure
on revenue and earnings in the short term I see much opportunity for us in the future.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Given all of our capabilities I am
confident Chubb will weather these difficult times and emerge stronger from this challenge.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
With that I'll turn the call over to Phil and then we'll be back to take your questions.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Philip V. Bancroft
Executive VP & CFO
Thank you Evan.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
I want to begin with a few words on our financial position which remains exceptionally strong.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Our
balance sheet includes a AA-rated investment portfolio with a relatively short duration and a conservative approach to
our loss reserves.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We have over $67 billion in total capital which as we enter this period is very strong stemming from
superior operating performance.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Our access to liquidity on a global basis is excellent and unimpaired.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Our operating cash
flow remains quite strong and was $1.7 billion for the quarter.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Net realized and unrealized losses for the quarter of $3.7 billion after tax included $2.2 billion from an investment portfolio
which resulted primarily from widening credit spreads in the investment-grade and high-yield bond portfolio through
March 31.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Even after considering the valuation adjustments noted our portfolio remained in an overall unrealized gain
position through the quarter end.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Since that time credit markets have recovered and liquidity has improved as a result of
the extraordinary actions taken by the fed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The portfolio mark has improved by
approximately $1.7 billion pretax through this Monday.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
We also had a mark-to-market loss on our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio of $560 million.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"This was primarily due
to negative equity returns and an increase in implied volatility.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Again this is purely a mark-to-market adjustment required
because the transactions are deemed to be derivatives for accounting purposes and it does not indicate a reduction in
cash flows from our reinsurance treaties for the quarter.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The results are in line with our expectations given these market
conditions.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Finally realized and unrealized losses included $896 million after-tax losses from FX related to our net asset exposure
to foreign currency.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"These represent a point-in-time mark-to-market valuation adjustment and do not affect the capital
position of our international operating units.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"As we noted in the press release the marks are market price-driven based on
the last day of the quarter and a moment in time.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We believe they are largely transient and will accrete back to book value
over time.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $893 million pretax and was within our guidance range.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"During March
we engaged on the margin in several tactical adjustments to the portfolio.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We purchased a modest amount of high-quality
equities and modestly increased our exposure to investment-grade corporate bonds.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"While there are a number of factors
that impact the variability in investment income we expect our quarterly run rate to remain in the range of $885 million to
$895 million.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $237 million pretax or $199 million after tax including $224 million from global
weather-related events and $13 million so far from COVID-19 which has been classified as an ongoing catastrophe.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"While there was no significant impact on core operating income in the first quarter relating to COVID-19 the company
anticipates that this global catastrophe event will have an impact on revenue as well as net and core operating income in

the second quarter and potentially future quarters as a result of an increase in insurance claims due to both the pandemic
and recessionary economic conditions.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"On a constant dollar basis net loss reserves increased $363 million in the quarter and include the impact of catastrophe
loss payments favorable prior period development and crop insurance payments in the quarter.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"On a reported basis the
paid-to-incurred ratio was 95%.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
After adjusting for the items noted above the paid-to-incurred ratio was 88%.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $118 million pretax or $94 million after tax.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The favorable
development is split approximately 28% in long-tail lines principally from accident years 2016 and prior and 72% in
short-tail lines.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Last year's favorable development of $204 million included $61 million of positive development from our
agriculture segment resulting from stronger-than-expected results from the 2018 crop year.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"As we said at year-end based
on a difficult 2019 crop year this level of development would not recur in the first quarter of 2020.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Among the capital-related actions in the quarter we returned $666 million to shareholders including $340 million in
dividends and $326 million in share repurchases at an average price of $142.67 per share.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Given the current economic
environment and to reserve capital for both risk and opportunity the company has suspended further share repurchases
indefinitely.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Our annualized core operating ROE in the quarter was 9.4% and our core operating return on tangible equity
was 15.1%.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.3%.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt

operating effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt

Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And with that we will take our first question from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
I guess the first question is going to be on the future impact on the wealth side from COVID in the coming quarters.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And obviously without giving numbers but maybe just where you feel Chubb is most exposed to that from I guess a
geographic and coverage perspective.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman President & CEO
I'm not going to give any specifics in that.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
There'll be -- it will come from a variety of areas as we imagine right now.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And
there'll be -- the reason we didn't put up numbers in the first quarter is because we're going to do it in a thoughtful way
based on claims that come in that are analyzed and reported.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And then we're able to have a framework to project to IBNR
with that in a thoughtful way as well.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
But claims will come from travel insurance and A&H.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We'll have business interruption
losses where we purposely provided coverage as opposed to where we -- to the vast majority where we did not provide
coverage.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
We'll have it through credit-related that is surety and trade credit and maybe political risk who knows?,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Workers' comp will
produce losses I'm sure.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And so it kind of gives you a sense and it will be -- I think it will be pretty broad-based because
it's created exposures for clients for the industries and the economies broadly.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And it will -- geography well over half our
business is in the United States.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"So I expect all things being equal since our greatest exposure is in the U.S. by territory
the greatest amount of loss will come out of the U.S. And I hope that helps you.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
Yes.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
It does.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"I know Evan you've been very actively involved in Task Force and things that are happening here in
the U.S. and I guess clearly all the pressure from states on BI and states on workers' comp and the big restaurants
that in bed with Trump and things like that all these different pressures in the U.S. And not really looking for your one
expectation but just your thoughts on how this all kind of shakes out given all the different scenarios on how the pressure
on insurance kind of unfolds and what to expect maybe as this thing kind of shakes out.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman President & CEO
The insurance industry is an important part of financial plumbing of our economy in the U.S. And frankly it's part of the
financial plumbing that's critical globally.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The insurance industry I think is performing quite well and I think will perform
very well in meeting their obligations and our obligations.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"When it comes to business interruption there is activity that I'd
put into 2 categories.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"One is on the political side where there's talk about retroactively imposing cover on insurers for
something that they didn't cover and didn't charge a premium.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"That is retroactively changing contract and increasing our
exposure.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
I think that that's unnecessary harm and would do great damage.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"It would damage or destroy the insurance
industry in a terrible way.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
It would simply take money from one to give to another.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Who does that serve?,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And frankly
it's unconstitutional and we are a constitutional democracy.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And preservation of that and the certainty of that in such
uncertain times is paramount.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
So I'd start with that.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Secondly the insurance industry for the most part except for those customers who discretely purchased it BI insurance
doesn't cover COVID-19.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
It covers and requires direct physical loss to a property.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And the regulators who've approved
these forms because we're highly regulated confirm that themselves that it's not contemplated.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Lawyers and the trial bar
will attempt to torture the language on standard industry forms and try to prove something exists that actually doesn't exist
and try to twist the intent when the intent is very clear.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
And the industry will fight this tooth and nail.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We will pay what we
owe.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And finally what I'd say is business interruption insurance actually we should remember is very good value for
money because what it does cover we pay out as an industry roughly from what we can estimate about $0.70 on the

And I'm glad you asked that question.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities Research Division
No.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Great.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Appreciate the color there.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And then just also you guys are obviously I think top 5 in the workers' comp
market.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Just wondering if you could give us a sense for the percentage of your book that is health care and other frontline
responders what sort of exposure you have there?",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman President & CEO
It's -- I won't give you specifics and only to say though health care is not a meaningful part of our book of business.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Operator
Your next question will come from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Research Division
Just a couple of questions.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"One I've heard a lot about cyber risk being greater in this environment with a lot of workers
working from home...
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman President & CEO
I can't hear you.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Can you speak more clearly?,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"I'm sorry just to...
Yaron Joseph Kinar

Can you hear me?",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Can you hear me better now?,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt

Chairman President & CEO
Now I can.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Research Division
Great.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
So my first question is around cyber.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
I know you guys have a large cyber practice.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"There's been speculation or
talk about an increased cyber risk considering that a lot of employees are working from home.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Do you see that as a large
issue?",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
And if so how can the industry address that?,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman President & CEO
No.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
To date we're not seeing a meaningful change in patterns.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Research Division
Okay.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
And then the second question is probably a more philosophical question.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"But I think you've seen several insurers
as renewals come up maybe articulate some of the exclusions around pandemic and around COVID-19 specifically in
policies.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Do you think that that actually could create an opening for the plaintiffs' bar to go after a prior language that was
maybe less explicit in the exclusions?",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman President & CEO
I can't speak to what people's manuscript forms look like.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And therefore whether they're correcting weaknesses with that
I can't speak to that.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
But generally no.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"I think COVID-19 or pandemic-related exclusions are just belt and suspenders on
policies -- on the basic policies that require direct physical loss.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Research Division
Okay.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"If I could sneak one other quick one in I think in response to Brian's question if we look at the vast majority of your
business interruption policies have physical damage trigger requirements.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Can you say anything about what -- how many
of your policies have viral exclusions?",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman President & CEO
No.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
It really -- no it's -- I'll leave it at that.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
No.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
There is -- it's -- where it's appropriate it does.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Operator
And we will take our next question from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
I guess I'll try one more time on this business interruption.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"But I mean I guess one question I have is should we -- is the
real question in terms of the business interruption exposure how many?",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Or is it how long does this lockdown happen?,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
What's kind of more relevant in terms of sizing that loss?,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman President & CEO
Say that again?",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt

CHUBB LIMITED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  APR 22 2020
Is the question more about the number of policies?",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Because that's sort of what the questioning had been so far that what
percentage might actively cover the virus.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"My question is how dependent would that loss ultimately be on how long the
lockdown is in place?",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Or in other words are there caps and limits on that?,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman President & CEO
There are caps and limits in all policies.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And duration of shutdown it's just axiomatic in business interruption that length of
shutdown can impact and does impact severity of loss pretty basic in any BI cover.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
Got you.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
And then my other question just taking a step back.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"I know you mentioned in the general op-ed this morning
that you think ultimately the industry will pay out tens of billions of dollars in claims.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Is there any reason in your mind that
you should think that Chubb's market share of those claims should be more or less than what its global market share is
currently as the global leader in P&C?",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman President & CEO
I think Chubb from everything I know we're a pretty good underwriter.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
We're a pretty buttoned-up disciplined shop.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
We have good controls within the organization.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And I have no reason to believe that Chubb would produce something
outsized.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Look this is a significant event for the industry and it's going to be a significant event for Chubb as well.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"It's an
earnings event.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
It's not a balance sheet event as I said.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And I do think it will be the largest loss single loss in industry
history when you add up both sides of the balance sheet and you look at the capital impact to the industry.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Operator
And our final question will come from Larry Greenberg with Janney.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Lawrence David Greenberg
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC Research Division
I just want to be certain that I understand the accounting and the intent of how you're going to recognize losses in the
second quarter.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"So should we assume that you will put up a catastrophe loss for what you expect will be your ultimate
exposure from COVID recognizing that so much is changing and there's a lot of unknowns down the road?",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"But is that
your plan?",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman President & CEO
We will let the facts speak to us.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We will put up our loss based on the facts as we know them at the time when we come
to close the books on the second quarter.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
And I'm not going to speculate ahead right now.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And we will then provide our
perspective and color around that to help define it and give you a sense.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"But I'm not going to speculate on where we'll be
by the end of the second quarter to give you definitive color on the question you have.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Lawrence David Greenberg
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC Research Division
Okay.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And then just on...
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman President & CEO
It will depend on what we know.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Get used to being in a world with a lot of unknowns and a lot of uncertainty right now.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And
you're requesting certainty when there's a great deal of uncertainty.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
And a lot of that is for worksheet projection-related.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
And I would caution against trying to overspeculate on any of it.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Lawrence David Greenberg

"spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16
CHUBB LIMITED FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  APR 22 2020
Yes.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
I'm really not asking for any level of certainty.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"But really just the intent to put a number up for what you -- given your
level of information at that given point of time for what you can best estimate as your ultimate exposure.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman President & CEO
Exactly right.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
We will put up and we always do our best estimate of ultimate loss to an event.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
We always do that.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And no
different here we're consistent that way.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
So you can expect that of us.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Lawrence David Greenberg
Janney Montgomery Scott LLC Research Division
And then just curious on your thoughts on legislative proposals that might be productive probably just prospectively.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"But is
there any conceivable model where government involvement could be helpful on a retrospective basis?",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman President & CEO
There is a -- I absolutely see a public-private partnership prospectively.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"I don't see the sense of one on some
retrospective.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
So there is -- and I'm going to give you both very quickly.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The retrospective one would say ""Well why don't
you pay the BI losses and the government will backstop you 100%?""",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Well right now the government's current program
to provide loans that then become grants if you retain your employees is a very efficient way versus now we create some
BI way.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
And by the way BI insurance to adjust a claim requires that you prove it's an ascertained net loss.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"You have to
prove what your expenses were and what -- and your loss of revenue and all of that.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And that's -- and the adjudication of
that is messy and takes time very -- it's time-consuming and it's one at a time.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And what matters right now is cash flow to
small businesses.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
And so it wouldn't be an efficient way of dealing with the cash flow needs.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The government has already
created a program.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
So what problem are we trying to solve?,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
On a prospective basis I see it differently.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
Why doesn't the industry underwrite pandemic?,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Because of the size of the tail
as I say it as it's an event that has no geographic or time limit.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And so the tail is so great the industry has a finite balance
sheet that can't take infinite risk.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"If the government would take the tail risk and take the significant loss on -- in a pandemic
event the industry I believe could take a retention.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
I could be underwriting pandemic.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"A little -- very different but a little
like think about TRIA.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
And I can tell you I'm in favor of a public-private partnership in shouldering the burden in the future.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
And Chubb has put together its own proposal.,2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And we will be sharing that around shortly with the appropriate parties both
inside the industry and outside the industry.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Operator
And this concludes today's question-and-answer session.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And I would now like to turn the call back to Karen Beyer for any
additional or closing remarks.",2020-3-31 Chubb Transcript.txt

"While The Hartford started 2020 with significant momentum
since our last call on February 4 all aspects of society and the global economy have been fundamentally changed by

"In light of that I plan to spend the bulk of my time today focused on the pandemic including how we are
responding and how we are preparing for what comes next.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
I want to begin by recognizing the human toll the pandemic is taking.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"On behalf of The Hartford and our more than 19000
employees my heart goes out to those who are affected by the virus.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

and extend my deepest gratitude to the health care professionals caring for them along with all the other workers on the

who have lost jobs and livelihoods those who are trying to balance working from home with child care and homeschooling
and those already vulnerable or suffering from the isolation brought about by physical distancing.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
People and businesses are facing circumstances they've never encountered before.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Now more than ever they seek

provide uninterrupted support and outstanding service that our customers expect.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  APR 30 2020
Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Thank you Chris and good morning everyone.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I echo your sentiment for those individuals and families impacted by
COVID-19 as well as our deep appreciation for frontline workers who are protecting and supporting all of us.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Against
that backdrop let me share commentary on the first quarter as well as perspective on our business in the face of this
pandemic.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Property & Casualty had a solid first quarter.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Core earnings were slightly better than both last year and our expectations.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I'm pleased with the continued pricing momentum that is critical to improving the financial performance of both Middle
Market and Global Specialty.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Let me get right into our business results.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Commercial Line's first quarter combined ratio was 99.1% increasing 3 points versus 2019.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"The underlying combined
ratio was 94.9 increasing 2.2 points.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"The deterioration was primarily due to expected compression in workers'
compensation margins in Small Commercial higher expenses and the inclusion of Navigators partially offset by favorable
non-CAT property results.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
For the quarter renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 3.8% up 30 basis points from fourth quarter.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Excluding workers' compensation pricing was 7.4% up nearly 1 point over fourth quarter including incremental monthly
progress over the past 3 months.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"In Middle Market renewal written pricing in the U.S. excluding workers' compensation
increased 9.4% up 180 basis points from fourth quarter and 570 basis points from first quarter of 2019.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Both property and
general liability pricing improved over 2 points since the fourth quarter and are now each in the high single digits.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"In Middle
Market excluding workers' compensation we've now achieved incremental pricing gains for 5 consecutive quarters.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
On our last call I provided quite a bit of texture to the pricing story in Global Specialty.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Let me provide a few updates.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We
continue to experience strong pricing gains in both our U.S. wholesale book as well as the international portfolio which
is primarily written in Lloyd's.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"The U.S. wholesale book achieved 21 points of rate in the first quarter over 2 points better
than the fourth quarter.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Several lines continued to achieve in excess of 20% including property auto and excess casualty.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
The international portfolio also had equally strong pricing gains with continued emphasis on professional lines and energy.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Additionally considerable portfolio reshaping continues including shifting industry and geographic mix raising attachment
points and reducing policy limits.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Combining these actions with our sustained pricing work I'm pleased with the improving
profit trajectory.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Let me pivot to Property & Casualty's loss results.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Catastrophes were relatively modest.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And outside of the unfavorable
development on U.S. ocean marine and Lloyd's syndicate reserves that were covered by ADC prior year development
on all other lines was insignificant in the quarter.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"COVID-19 loss trends were immature at March 31 and therefore had a
limited impact on our results.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Let me share a few more details on our commercial businesses beginning with Small Commercial which had another
very strong quarter posting an underlying combined ratio of 89.3.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"The current accident year loss ratio improved 0.8 point
as favorable non-CAT property results more than offset the margin compression in workers' compensation.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"As discussed
in the past this expected compression was driven by negative workers' compensation pricing.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"In addition as you'll see across Property & Casualty segments expense ratio deterioration was driven by lower 2019
state tax assessments and a higher bad debt allowance recorded this quarter.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"The bad debt allowance increase was
$12 million in Small Commercial and $18 million across Property & Casualty reflecting the expected impacts of higher
customer defaults.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Small Commercial written premium was flat to last year.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Our new business sales for the quarter were $157 million down
10%.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
This decrease was driven by the new business written in 2019 from the Foremost renewal rights transaction.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Middle & Large Commercial reported an underlying combined ratio of 100.4 in the first quarter an increase of 2.3 points.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"In addition to the expense items mentioned earlier approximately 1 point of the increase related to a higher current
accident year loss pick for general liability.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Written premium increased 5% driven by strong growth in loss-sensitive
construction and the addition of The Navigatorsâ€™ retail excess casualty business.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Retention and new business
production in Standard Commercial Middle Market business both declined due to rate and underwriting actions we're
taking across the book.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

In Global Specialty the underlying combined ratio was 96.4 improving 2.1 points from the second half of 2019.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"As
I mentioned earlier pricing and book re-underwriting actions are drivers of the improved results.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"In addition Global
Specialty delivered $217 million of direct new written premium in the quarter.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We remain very encouraged about the
breadth of our new product offerings and the long-range core earnings forecast for Global Specialty.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Shifting over to Personal Lines.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We're pleased with the performance producing an underlying combined ratio of 86.6
improving 2.5 points from a year ago.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"In Personal Lines auto the underlying combined ratio of 90.9 was 2.7 points better
than 2019.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Favorable frequency trends driven by the relatively mild winter and shelter-in-place guidelines contributed to
the improved results.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Severity was largely in line with expectations.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Now let me step back from our business results and reflect on the new challenges that COVID-19 will bring over the
coming quarter and into the rest of the year.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Operationally we executed flawlessly.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"In a matter of days from decision to
execution almost our entire team moved to fully remote status without missing a beat.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"The resiliency of our employees
and their dedication to brokers and customers during the past 7 weeks has been inspiring.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
As we look ahead to the next few months I would offer a few key points as it relates to the global pandemic.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"First we
communicated adjustments to normal business practices including providing additional time to pay premium and offering
flexible payment options extending billing grace periods through May 31 and the waiver of any late fees that would
otherwise apply; relaxing policy renewal requirements and deadlines as well as premium audit obligations; and adjusting
policy conditions to be responsive to extended vacancies caused by shelter-in-place guidelines.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"In addition since mid-
March we've endorsed more than 80000 policies and returned over $15 million of premium to customers.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We've also
announced a 15% refund of April and May's personal auto premium due through a reduction in miles driven and lower
reported claims.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Second we expect that COVID-19 will have an impact on our premium flows.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Let me start with Small Commercial.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We expect our normally strong retentions to be impacted by both reductions in exposure as well as business
closures.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Reductions in exposure will likely be driven by lower customer payroll and sales primarily impacting workers'
compensation but also our business owners policy Spectrum to a lesser degree.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Our new business activity clearly slowed in the latter half of March and into April consistent with U.S. Census Bureau
statistics that point toward an approximate 25% decline in national new business applications.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We expect a similar drop
in new business premium for the full second quarter.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Written premium could be down approximately 15% in the second
quarter.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Relative to Middle Large and Specialty we expect retention and pricing trends during the second quarter to remain
generally consistent with prior quarters.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Risk managers are juggling many priorities and I expect customers will change
carriers less often in this environment.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
This obviously means that new business levels will be off.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Exposure reductions by
way of endorsement will continue but not to the extent of small business.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Finally there's been much written about losses related to the virus much of it misinformed.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We continue to pay claims
according to our contract terms and conditions.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"As Chris said we will vigorously defend against any and all attempts to
unfairly disregard or broaden the terms and conditions of our policies.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"These contracts have formed the foundation for our
industry over decades.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
We will contest retroactive changes at every corner.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
As I close let me again express my confidence in my teammates here at The Hartford.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We've built a strong foundation
for our future.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Our insurance and risk management platform is poised for greater success as both organic and new
capabilities blend together.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We will be thoughtful with our decisions dealing with this pandemic and we will continue to be
the company our customers agents and shareholders can count on.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

Our investment portfolio is broadly diversified and high-quality with an overall average credit rating of A+.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"As the business
cycle aged over the last couple of years we were active in reducing the risk profile of the portfolio and as a result have
relatively small allocations to below investment-grade securities equities and limited partnerships.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"The fixed maturity

"The corporate exposure to higher-risk
industries including energy leisure and entertainment and airlines is very manageable and largely investment-grade with
a significant percentage in private placements that offer covenants to better protect our investment.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We deliberately seek to diversify our corporate and municipal risks through our allocations to structured products and
commercial mortgage loans.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

coverage of about 2.5x coming into this crisis with no exposure to hospitality or retail malls.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"In addition since the end of
March we reduced our equity exposure taking advantage of the bounce in equities to further reduce risk investing the
proceeds primarily in high-quality fixed income investments.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Net investment income was $459 million for the quarter down $44 million from the fourth quarter of 2019 driven in part
by lower income from make-whole payments and mortgage loan prepayments and valuation declines on equity fund
investments in first quarter 2020.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
For the quarter the current yield before tax excluding limited partnerships was 3.3%.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"For the second quarter we would
expect the yield to be flat with the first quarter.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We have taken actions to increase liquidity to offset the expected decrease
in premium receipts due to COVID-19 including the effect of the billing relief that we have provided to our policyholders.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"For the second quarter yield outlook of 3.3% the impact of this increase in liquidity is roughly offset by the assumed
absence of the valuation declines in equity fund investments experienced in the first quarter.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"The annualized limited partnership return was 13.2% in the first quarter primarily due to strong private equity valuations
and distributions.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"As a reminder LP returns are reported on a quarter lag so we would expect to see second quarter
results negatively impacted by the market decline in the first quarter.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"The net unrealized gain position of $600 million after tax on fixed maturities decreased by $1.1 billion from year-end driven
predominantly by significantly wider credit spreads partially offset by lower interest rates.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Unrealized and realized losses
on equity securities net of gains on equity derivatives which are recorded within net realized capital losses in the income
statement were $311 million before tax in the quarter reflecting the impact of the equity market decline.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

Question and Answer

[Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
A couple of questions here.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
First Chris and Doug could you perhaps comment on the business interruption coverages?,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And specifically how much of your business in the property and kind of bought business has a virus endorsement on it so
where your exposure there is?",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And then additionally could you comment on what percentage of your policies actually has
a specific virus exclusion with respect to the business interruption coverage?",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Brian thank you.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
I hope you're well.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So I would say a couple of things.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"One I'm extremely confident in our underwriting
and contractual terms.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And we've really done an exhaustive review over the last 6 7 weeks of all our policies including
Navigators.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And I would just tell you straight up that the vast vast majority of our contracts do have a virus exclusion and
that there could be a handful of occasions where in essence we've offered business interruption coverage without tied to
physical damage or property loss.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
But again a handful and those policies actually came from our Navigators acquisition.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So I think we got our arms around our policies our exposures.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Our teams have really scrubbed everything over and over.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
But Doug that's what I would share with Brian.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
I think that's a good summary Chris.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Brian Robert Meredith

Did you book those ones with the endorsement in the quarterâ€¦
Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
What I would say when we closed out the quarter obviously we booked what we knew.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And that's why we took the
actions that you saw where we did from a receivable side a credit side from the Group Benefits side.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And that's what
we booked.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
We booked what we saw what we were aware of.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And I would say specifically no there was no specific
provision for a handful of those policies that I referred to that do have BI.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

"Brian Robert Meredith

Got you.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And then second question could you comment on the impact of the expanded kind of coverage presumption
we're seeing in workers' comp in various states?",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Lots of numbers being thrown out there by some of the kind of industry
NCCI et cetera et cetera.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
What are your thoughts on that?,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
What's the potential impact on The Hartford et cetera?,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Well it's -- as you said it's been active.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And again as I said in my prepared comments I understand that people
are trying to take care of people in their states employees and things like that.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But if you really study the history of the
workers' comp environment over the last 50 years it's a well-functioning well-understood business activity that I think
fairly compensates people that have been injured or obviously get sick at work.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

So I think the rules of the road are generally understood.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And to expand presumptions to relax documentation to sort of
change the equation I think as you see it can be very disruptive to the industry.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"That said yes I do have some personal
sensitivities and for frontline health care workers and those that are treating the sick out of this virus and maybe there's
combinations or things that we could do there.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But broad-based presumptions for many classes of business Brian just
doesn't make sense to me.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot

Brian the only thing I would add is that several states are talking about this presumption dynamic of workers' comp.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I'm
not sure there are any 2 states that are the same.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So it's a variety across states.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

And the next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Meyer Shields
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. Research Division
A couple of questions one big one.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Doug in your prepared remarks you mentioned that there is some I guess
misinformed commentary.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I was hoping you could -- would talk about what commentary you're seeing out there that
doesn't match your perception.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot

Yes.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment Meyer about specifics.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We treat each and every claim on its own
merits.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
We're looking at all the claims as they come in.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
We've been responsive.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We're working through all the variety of
lines and coverages et cetera.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So I think our claim group has done an outstanding job.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"It just frustrates me at times when
I feel like sometimes the press looks at us and doesn't give us the credit that I believe we deserve for what we do and how
we support the marketplace.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Meyer Shields
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. Research Division
Okay.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Understood.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"The second question can you give us some insight in terms of changes to commercial auto claim
frequency that you've seen over the last 6 weeks or so?",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
We have our -- I'll say this our claim counts have been down both across personal and commercial.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"When it was clear by
the end of March that they were down for that 2-week period and expect it to continue into the second quarter Beth and I
and Stephanie Bush our entire group sat and worked through and ended up with the 15% refund for April and May.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"That
approximates $50 million plus or minus in money going back to customers.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

And then in your 10-Q it sounds like you do expect to get reinsurance coverage on the occurrence treaties but it sounds
like you expect limited recoveries given your current estimates of losses.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Should I take that to mean that you expect the
losses in 2Q to be under $150 million?",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
David thanks for joining us.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I think what you're reading and interpreting in the Q is really off base just fundamentally
off base.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
I think how we've always prepared our Qs is -- I mean we try to describe risk factors.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We try to describe
conditions so that there is a level of clarity.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"You should not read anything in the Q as predicting a loss an attachment
point a session that we expect at this point in time.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I think all we were pointing out though is like any property loss we do
have certain levels of reinsurance on an aggregate and per risk basis.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But do not do not interpret that as a loss limit or us
trying to signal anything.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
That's just good disclosure.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Second on I'll call it the Navigator piece Doug.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Again we're not going to get into the specifics.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But all I would say again
handful of policies and there's aggregate limits in all of them.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
For BI we knew it's -- we knew about the program.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"It's a
program geared towards the entertainment industry.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And once we come up with final final estimates we'll tell you when
we book them in the second quarter.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
I would just add to that Chris.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"When I think about the Navigator property book it is very insignificant compared to the
size of our overall property book so less than 0.5% relative to policy count.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And their book is both primary and excess.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"In
their primary book generally they do not have virus exclusions.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But across our entire property base again I go back to
the vast majority of our policies have the virus exclusion.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And we will work through those claims during the course of the
second and third quarters and come to our estimates as we close out next quarter.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO
Yes.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"The only thing that I'll add to the first part of the question and I agree with Chris' comments as it relates to things that
we commented on in our risk factors I think you may have been asking specifically about our property catastrophe treaty.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And we did specifically say that pandemic is not excluded from that treaty.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And obviously given the level of losses that
would have to be in order for us to hit that we see that as very unlikely.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So I think that that was the specific disclosure
that you were -- may have been referring to.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"David Kenneth Motemaden

That's right.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

guess how long do you expect this to continue?",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

"It really is just a classic crisis playbook
right?",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
I mean you have to admit we're in the midst of a crisis.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And when we started looking at things late February early
March saw where spreads were going in the markets just game theory-ing other conditions we wanted as much liquidity
and flexibility as possible.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So we decided and took the action to not reinvest principal and interest coming off the portfolio
into new credit exposures at that time because you saw the Fed didn't act until at least 2 or 3 weeks later.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And it was just
a defensive cautionary position.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And I think all Beth and I really wanted to do was just tell you what we did why and the
potential impacts on our run rate yield or NII from managing your expectations Beth.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

"I mean again I think if you go back and look over what's happened over the last
couple of months as Chris said when we looked at this beginning of March it was really more a reaction of the fact that
we saw markets and specifically credit markets were feeling stressed and we didn't want to be investing into that.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"As we
go through March and then we get towards the end of March into April we have more shelter-in-place orders and so forth
and some of the actions that we're taking to provide relief to our customers and the receipt of premium payments caused
us to continue to want to build liquidity.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

to top line and those receipts we'd look to start then reinvesting again.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

other frontline workers and then maybe more on [ peripheral ] industries like supermarkets et cetera.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And just give us a
sense of the areas and the exposure within your book that you think were most likely to see losses within that line from
COVID.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Elyse I think the only detail I'm comfortable sharing with you is for our Small Commercial and Middle Market book how
you would define health care or how we would define health care which excludes dentists and optometrists that we
would ensure our health care exposure to those on the frontline basis is less than 5% of our premium.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"That's the only data
point I'd like to give you at this point in time and I'm not going to break down our entire book of business for you and give

"I know there was one commercial carrier which said last
week they maybe change their reserving policies a little bit and they release less reserves to be a little more conservative
to take into account that the last recession kind of surprised them a little bit on the back end which I believe may have
also kind of happened industry-wide and to Hartford as well.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Let me start with a few comments to frame this.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
I'd start by saying that our accounts are down.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But as you know we are
also working day-by-day on exposure changes with our policyholders.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So until we get that exposure base where it needs
to be it's very difficult to predict frequency.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
But I expect over the short term we'll see improvements in claim counts.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"If
nothing else we understand across our manufacturing book we'll see more experienced workers.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"As people thin their
ranks what we'll tend to see will be more experienced workers on those lines.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And as such they will get injured less
frequently.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
We're watching careful medical severity.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We think there will be a little bit of pressure on duration and also medical
severity.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
There's an awful lot of medical attention in this country right now dealing with COVID-19.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And as such we're
slightly concerned that maybe all the people that need medical attention for other job-related injuries are stacking up in
the queue.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So there are assortment of things relative to workers' compensation we're keeping our eye on some good and
some pressure points to watch even putting the presumption discussion to the side.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

Mike I would just give you a larger-picture perspective in that.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I mean if you're looking back to the Great Recession or
other recessions that the U.S. economy has experienced it is true that obviously unemployment and GDP is going to
shrink.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"A lot of those other recessions were caused by structural issues whether it be credit overextended or imbalances
in the economy.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Remember this was a shock to our U.S. economy.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And the real hope and belief at least I have is with the great
advances in the medical community and some of the things that everyone's talking about and working on we can remove
the shock factor and go back to a structurally sound consumer-orientated economy that isn't stretched financially isn't
out of balance in any way shape or form.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So -- but it's true.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"That might take some time to get the medical advancements
necessary to relieve the shock that the economy is experiencing.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG Research Division
Great.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
That's helpful.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
My last question is regarding more broadly commercial pricing.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Do you feel that youâ€™ve been
seeing kind of pricing industry-wide continue to move north/higher given the kind of uncertainty surrounding a lot of
issues?",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Or are top line contractions causing more broadly kind of pricing to move downwards a bit?,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And I'm speaking
specifically to commercial pricing.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But if you have views on also Personal Lines pricing given that seems to be a good
area to be at I'd be open to those as well.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Tackle commercial first.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
I would suggest that the early look at April April is not complete yet it will be tonight.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But the early
look suggests consistency with what we saw in March.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So the early part of the second quarter I think will exhibit similar
patterns to what finished quarter 1.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And we'll obviously continue to watch this and manage this on a month-to-month basis
as we move into quarter 2.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Personal Lines I think there are a lot of things going on in Personal Lines including the fact that there's a fair amount
of customer premium refunding going on in Q2 and a lot happening based on miles driven but also now the potential
turn on -- turn back on of the economy.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And one of the things we've debated amongst ourselves is I think we expect to
see potentially a bounce back in miles driven over the course of the summer.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"As people return to more normal living
conditions we expect miles driven to go up as a result maybe fewer airline miles traveled but more within their cars.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So
those are all thoughts over the ensuing 3 to 4 months.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But at the moment yes miles are down and we expect that to
change.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG Research Division
Okay.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Great.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
We all hope you're right about the return to normalcy in the coming months.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Operator
And the next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
I had a question for Doug and then a Group Benefits question which I guess might also be for Doug.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But I just recovered
the property cat stuff on reinsurance.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Could you give us some indication of how some of the per-risk reinsurance on the
quota share where might that respond to any potential COVID losses?",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Well you're right.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
We do have per-risk insurance inside our core property book.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And obviously that would be on a risk-by-
risk basis so that will depend on severity of risk.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And those plans are in place.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And there are no virus exclusions attached
to those programs.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So that stands as is.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"There are also an assortment of other programs including Navigators has a quota share program across their property
book heavily reinsured.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So you'd almost need the specific circumstance of the loss Ryan to figure out how it applies.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But

number one I would say I believe we've got sound underwriting on our primary book.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And number two I think we've got a
well-thought out reinsurance program that will respond if indeed it's called to.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
Okay.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
I think the other thing I wanted to hit on I guess was in Group Benefits.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"It seems like the short-term disability kind
of dwarfs the impact of workers' comp even though that's what everyone's been talking about.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Is it safe to think that if
conditions remain like this that that $16 million for half a month would have that type of proportional impact I guess on
ensuing quarters?",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Ryan it's Chris.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
I would say no.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
I would not do that and I'll tell you why.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"If you sort of break down what we booked $10
million was for paid family leave $6 million was for STD.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I would say when we booked and made our estimates for the
quarter we had a claim count estimate a duration estimate.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And then it's simple math from there.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"The claim count that actually emerged and again New York paid family leave primarily is our risk product there is just
significantly down from what we expected.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So it's not to say it can't come back.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"It's not to say it couldn't spike as people
look at all the benefits that are available to them.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
But that claim count projection was off by a factor of at least 50%.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"On STD I would share with you the view that we had again has changed a little bit as we got into April in that the impact
that we booked was for increased COVID-19 STDs.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And to remind you there's usually a 7-day elimination period.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And
again then if someone goes on STD because of COVID-19 generally what we're seeing is a 10-day to 2-week benefit.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But there again the data that emerged in April is that yes COVID-19 claims are up but everything else is down quite
substantially.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So the normal STD claims or the planned absence STD claims everyone is sort of delaying normal activities
as it would be related to STD coverages.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So net-net the total claim projection or the claims and how they're emerging in
April is basically flat to slightly down with historical trends.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Now that too could reverse.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
But as it reverses I think we would have less COVID-19 claims going forward.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So I would
not project it on a run rate basis and we'll give you transparency to what we do in the second quarter.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But at least right
now there's offsetting factors that should mitigate losses.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
Got it.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And I guess the one follow-up I had is kind of a mechanical one probably for Doug as well.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But some of these
comp studies we're seeing where -- whether it's the NCCI where you're coming up with a gross workers' comp loss
estimate what are some things we should be thinking about in terms of how deductible -- in reality how that makes its
way to a loss in an insurance company right the impact that a company deductible might have to mitigate that or the
fact that it might not even make it to workers' comp right?",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I guess it could become a short-term disability claim or maybe
health insurance might cover it.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I'm just trying to understand like trying to net that down to those gross numbers what are
some things we should be thinking about?",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Just a few comments.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
It's so hard to project here.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But yes the national account customer segment Fortune 2000 plus
many have some form of loss responsive program where there's either a deductible attached some kind of retention
arrangement.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So yes that would not all just flow directly into comp losses.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
In terms of Main Street America much of Middle Market America I think those contracts are largely guaranteed costs.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So
those are risk-transfer programs.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And again this is going to be a state-by-state dynamic.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"But I would think much of that
content change would show up in the P&L of insurers over time.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And then the last thought I have for you is that the fundamental way we run this business is that we take historical losses
and we run them through our actuarial model and then we develop rates going forward based on all the risks we're

taking.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And I fully expect whether we're talking workers' comp or property as we come out of this COVID-19 experience
we'll be doing exactly that with those losses paid.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Operator
And the next question comes from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
Just Chris is it simply that it was just -- it's too early?",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Just curious on I guess the rationale for not putting out any kind of
expected number on the P&C side for COVID losses right now.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Again we reacted to what we know and what we saw.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
If you really think about it it was 2 weeks of the month.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And
really what I'd like you to take away from it is there isn't any big surprises out there that we don't see or understand
meaning we're not in certain lines of business that people put up a lot of reserves.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I mean we're not in the event
cancellation business.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
We don't have material trade credit exposures or anything along those lines.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"We don't have a
travel business.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
So we have our core products and our core capabilities.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And yes I mean 2 weeks for -- into the virus
to sort of make any type of adjustment.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And the accounting is I mean we can't book second quarter events in the first
quarter right?",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
I mean it's got to be sort of a known and exposed first quarter events.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So we'll see what develops here in
the second quarter but we're not setting out anything big in my judgment.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
Okay.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And then I guess lastly any thoughts you could share on expectations for earnings over the rest of the year for the
Talcott business?",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
Well let's get through the crisis and the immediate events here.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I mean we're not going to re-project or give new
guidance at this point in time.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So...

I'm sorry.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

Guidance for the rest of the year.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

Oh excuse me.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"Beth A. Costello

So yes so that's hard to predict obviously.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
As we said we record Talcott earnings on a quarter lag.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"So we typically get
their financial statements 45 50 days after quarter end.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"I'd expect that given their -- the hedging profile of that entity that

we're likely to see gains from the first quarter.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And I'd point you to look at first quarter of 2019 when they recorded the
impact of the fourth quarter of 2018 and the impact of hedging gains that we saw there.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
And then as far as predicting dividends I mean that gets difficult to do.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
We were pleased to get a dividend last year.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"And
we know that their plan is to continue to pay dividends.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
But until we get the cash in the door we don't count it.,2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt
"It's not
included in any of our holding company projections of cash flows.",2020-3-31 The Hartford Transcript.txt

Thank you.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Good morning and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2020 results.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Given the current
circumstances we hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We released our press release financial
supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"All of those materials can be found on our website at

"Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 segment
Presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of
Personal Insurance.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"They will
refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and they will take questions -- then we will take
questions.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Before I turn the call over to Alan I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the
webcast presentation.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The company cautions investors
that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Actual
results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-
Q and 10-K filed with the SEC.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Also in our
remarks or responses to questions we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Reconciliations are included
in our recent earnings press release financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our
website.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Thank you Abbe.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The events of the last few months have
been challenging for all of us and our hearts go out to all those affected by the global crisis.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Before I get to the impacts of
the pandemic on our business and comment on our first quarter results I'd like to acknowledge some acts of courage.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"First I want to express our appreciation for the thoughtful actions taken by our leaders and government at all levels
to keep us safe and support the well-being of individuals and businesses.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Their actions remind us that a society-wide
pandemic requires a society-wide response.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We would also like to extend our deep gratitude to the courageous efforts
of health care professionals and first responders for their selfless commitment to protecting and saving lives.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And for all
the essential workers who are putting others first as they continue to fill prescriptions stock shelves deliver goods and
provide the other key services we all depend upon.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Literally and figuratively they are keeping the lights on and we're
grateful.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In addition I want to acknowledge and thank all of my 30000 colleagues many of whom are listening this morning for
their exceptional response to this crisis.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Employees across Travelers have stepped up in amazing ways to ensure that
we can continue to deliver the risk management products and services that our customers need to live their lives and
run their businesses as well as the outstanding uninterrupted service that our customers and agent and broker partners
have come to expect.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Thanks to the commitment and resourcefulness of Travelers' employees and the tremendous efforts
of our technology and operations teams we transitioned our workforce practically overnight to safely and effectively
work from home.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"A few months ago it would have been hard to envision that we would have more than 29000 people

simultaneously logging in remotely and that we would be hosting more than 80000 virtual meetings on a daily basis but
we are doing just that.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
As we have discussed over the last few years we've been making investments in talent and technology.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And those
investments are paying off in terms of our ability to keep our employees safe and take care of our customers and
business partners.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As a company we are also grateful to be in a position to support those impacted by COVID-19
including through customer billing relief our stay-at-home auto premium credit program our distribution support plan
accelerating the payment of more than $100 million of commissions for agents and brokers and a direct $5 million pledge
to assist hard-hit families and communities.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
This pandemic has created a tremendous amount of uncertainty for all of us.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Nonetheless let me turn to highlighting some of the potential impacts of COVID-19 and the macroeconomic environment
on our business.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
I'll start with the top line.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
As you've heard us say as a property and casualty insurer we're a GDP-based business.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We
ensure the output of the economy.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As a result we and the industry will be impacted by lower premium levels as the
economy contracts.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"How much and for how long will depend on the extent and duration of the negative economic impacts
related to the pandemic.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We've always been very attentive to our expense base and we continue to be thoughtful in
that regard.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
In the context of the current environment we will make adjustments to our expenses where it makes sense.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But we do not plan to make significant adjustments to our fixed expense base in response to short-term fluctuations in
business volumes.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Accordingly as a consequence of pressure on the top line we expect an increase in our expense ratio
in the near term.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
In terms of our investment portfolio the economic fallout from the pandemic will impact our net investment income.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Dan
will have more to say about that shortly.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to loss costs there will be COVID-19-related loss activity.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But generally
as exposures decline there will to one degree or another be some corresponding decline in losses.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"What that will mean
in terms of profitability will depend on the relationship between the decline in earned premium and the decline in losses.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In
other words loss ratios could improve or deteriorate and that will vary by line.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Short-term impacts could also be different
than longer-term impacts.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to some of our key lines of business.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In Personal Auto in recent weeks we have seen a meaningful drop-off in
auto frequency.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As a result we announced our stay-at-home auto premium credit program offering a premium credit to
our customers for April and May.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
At the same time there may be some offsetting impact in terms of auto severity.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"For
example severity could be impacted as lower levels of traffic results in collisions occurring at higher speeds.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to our commercial businesses.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In workers' compensation while it varies by state generally claims for injury or
disease are compensable when the employee demonstrates that the injury or illness arose both out of and in the course
of their employment.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"With respect to COVID-19 these claims will most likely be applicable in the case of health care
workers and other first responders which does not represent a significant part of our book of business.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Some states have
taken steps to effectively expand the scope of workers' comp coverage by creating presumptions of compensability.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Other
states are considering doing the same.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"There are a few dynamics to this that argue for policymakers and regulators to
take a careful approach.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
First from a marketplace perspective shifting the exposure to the workers' comp system will increase loss costs.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"That
will be reflected in rate making increasing the cost of workers' comp insurance going forward.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Also those states that have
workers' compensation funds would presumably bear their proportionate share of the cost.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In any event we're watching
this closely.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
In management liability there is potential for elevated frequency.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"For example under public company D&O
policies we generally associate stock market volatility with a higher frequency of claims related to securities class actions.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
However given the breadth of the market decline causation may be harder for plaintiffs to prove in those cases.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Also by way of example underemployment practices liability coverage we expect additional claim activity related to
the increase in furloughs and layoffs of employees.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Surety loss activity for the industry and for us could be elevated
depending on the duration of the economic shutdown and the depth and duration of stress in the economy.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"While projects
have been impacted by shelter-in-place orders our sense is that the vast majority of projects have been permitted to
proceed and contractors are currently still working.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We believe that force majeure or other provisions included in many
construction contracts would as a general matter provide relief to contractors for late completion due to COVID-19.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Surety loss experience will also be impacted by other factors.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"For example the financial strength of the bonded firms the
types of bonds written and security arrangements.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Our high-quality surety book was effectively stress-tested in the 2008
financial crisis and performed well and our underwriting approach has remained disciplined since that time.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  APR 21 2020
I'll take a minute and comment on business interruption coverages under commercial property policies.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Let me begin
by saying that for every claim without exception we start by looking at the facts of the claim and the terms of the policy
to determine whether the claim is covered or not.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"That said our commercial property insurance policies that include
business interruption including as a result of civil authority require losses to be caused by direct physical damage to
property from a covered cause of loss.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In addition our standard policy form specifically excludes loss or damage caused
by/or resulting from a virus.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"More broadly the issue of retroactively expanding coverage beyond the original intent of a
policy is important for the industry.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
So let me make a few additional observations.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Insurers don't collect premiums to cover losses that policies weren't written
to cover requiring those losses to be covered retroactively on any broad scale would overwhelm the industry's plain
staying ability for legitimate claims unfairly leaving many individuals and businesses exposed.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"To that point the industry's
financial strength is especially important in a time of increased natural catastrophes.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The spring tornado season is already
active hurricane season is fast approaching and wildfires represents an ongoing threat.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"On top of all of that contract certainty is a core underpinning of the U.S. free market system and any effort to undermine
that has the potential to set a dangerous precedent.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Finally with respect to liability coverages in the near term as people
shelter in place we are seeing fewer commercial auto accidents and slip-and-fall type claims.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In addition we are seeing
some movement by the plaintiffs' bar to settle claims faster.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"On the other hand we expect that the plaintiffs' bar will seek
to generate COVID-related litigation.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Let me take a minute to address a related and important policy issue.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The trial bar is already actively soliciting plaintiffs
for cases related to the pandemic.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"A number of lawsuits have already been filed including related to the manufacture
and distribution of hand sanitizer and efforts to develop COVID-19 vaccine.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Those aren't our insureds so I don't have
a view on the merits of those cases.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But we should all be concerned that many frivolous lawsuits will be brought and
will undermine the nation's recovery including by delaying and adding expense to R&D related to the development and
distribution of COVID-19 tests and therapeutics deterring employers from responsibly bringing employees back to work
and retail businesses from responsibly opening to customers and targeting highly vulnerable businesses like those in the
health care and travel industries that can't afford the distraction or the expense.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
On top of these specific concerns as I'm sure you're aware the United States has the highest tort tax in the world.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"According to a recent study by the Institute for Legal Reform tort costs amount to more than $3300 per U.S. household
and much more than that in some states.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Americans shouldn't have to endure that and they can't afford to at the moment.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In other words our recovery from this crisis would benefit considerably from commonsense tort reform as well as legal
liability protection for our health care heroes firms involved in recovery efforts and all businesses seeking to reopen.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
I'll now turn to our first quarter results.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"This morning we reported core income of $676 million and core return on equity of
11.5%.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As compared to the prior year the results for the quarter were adversely impacted by a higher level of catastrophe
losses and charges related to the pandemic both of which Dan will address shortly.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Our underlying underwriting income
in the quarter was higher than the prior year benefiting from record first quarter net earned premium of $7.2 billion and an
underlying combined ratio which improved to 91.3% despite $86 million of pretax COVID-19-related charges.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Our high-
quality investment portfolio performed well generating net investment income of $519 million after-tax.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to production.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We executed successfully on our marketplace strategies and grew net written premium by 4%
and more than $7.3 billion.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Given the timing of the pandemic the impact of COVID-19 on production generally wasn't
significant for the quarter.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Net written premiums and business insurance increased 1%.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Domestic renewal premium
change was strong at 7.8% including renewal rate change of 6.2%.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Renewal rate change was up again both sequentially
and year-over-year while retention remained very strong.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In Bond & Specialty Insurance net written premiums increased by 13% with strong growth in both our Management
Liability and Surety businesses.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Renewal premium change in our domestic management liability business was 7.5% up
more than 3 points over the prior year quarter while retention remained historically high at 89%.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In Personal Insurance
net written premiums increased by 8% with Agency Homeowners up 18% and Agency Auto up 3% with both lines
benefiting from strong production.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Across all 3 of our segments we are pleased with our production results and we will
continue to execute to meet our target returns.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"You'll hear more shortly from Greg Tom and Michael about our segment
results.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I'll close by saying that in this moment of uncertainty our stakeholders can count on us to continue to operate consistent
with our long-term financial strategy as we have for many years and through other challenging periods of uncertainty.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

"Daniel Stephen Frey
Executive VP & CFO
Thank you Alan.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Core income for the first quarter was $676 million down from $755 million in the prior year quarter and
core ROE was 11.5% down from 13%.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The change in both measures from last year's first quarter resulted primarily from
a higher level of catastrophe losses compared to a relatively quiet cat quarter last year.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"First quarter results also include
the adverse impact of COVID-19 which I'll provide more color on in a moment.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Our first quarter results include $333 million of pretax cat losses $140 million higher than last year's first quarter.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"This
quarter's cats include $182 million from the March tornado activity in Nashville.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"PYD in the current quarter for which I'll
provide more detail shortly was net favorable $27 million pretax.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The underlying combined ratio of 91.3% which excludes
the impacts of cats and PYD was strong and improved by 0.3 point from the prior year quarter.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Our pretax underlying
underwriting gain of $594 million was 11% higher than in the prior year quarter reflecting the volume benefit from higher
levels of earned premium in all 3 business segments lower levels of noncatastrophe weather losses and an improved loss
ratio in personal insurance auto.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"These benefits were partially offset by the current quarter impact of increases to loss ratios in the commercial businesses
recognized during the second third and fourth quarters of 2019 all of which we discussed in previous calls.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And
the impacts related to COVID-19 including first quarter loss estimates and increase in the provision for uncollectible
receivables and a reduction in our estimate of ultimate audit premiums receivable.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The expense ratio of 30% reflects our
ongoing focus on productivity and efficiency.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The first quarter expense ratio includes nearly 0.5 point of elevated bad debt
expense related to the impact of COVID-19.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"After-tax net investment income increased by 5% from the prior year quarter to $519 million driven by higher returns in
our nonfixed income portfolio.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Recall that results for our private equities hedge funds and real estate partnerships are
generally reported to us on a 1 quarter lag.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So the impact of the disruption in global financial markets that occurred in the
latter half of the first quarter will impact our second quarter results.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"While not perfectly correlated our nonfixed income
returns directionally follow the broader equity markets which were down 15% to 30% during the first quarter.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"To the extent
the broader markets may recover in the second quarter and beyond our portfolio would then see that benefit in future
periods on a lagging basis.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In the current environment providing an outlook on our expectations for fixed income results
for the remainder of 2020 comes with more uncertainty than usual.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Having said that as a result of the recent decline in short-term yields we expect that fixed income NII will decrease by
approximately $20 million after-tax per quarter compared to the corresponding periods of 2019.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to prior year reserve development.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In Personal Insurance both auto and property losses came in better than
expected for multiple accident years.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In Business Insurance net favorable PYD was driven by better-than-expected loss
experience in workers' comp and commercial property largely offset by unfavorable results in commercial auto.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Each of
this quarter's movements are relatively small when compared to the reserve base.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Regarding reinsurance as discussed
during our fourth quarter results call we did renew our property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty for 2020 providing
aggregate coverage of $280 million part of $500 million of losses above an aggregate retention of $1.55 billion.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Through
March we had accumulated $414 million of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to capital management.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Operating cash flows for the quarter of $628 million were again very strong.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"All our capital
ratios were at or better-than-target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately
$1.6 billion well above our target level.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Investment yields increased modestly as credit spreads widened during the first
quarter.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And accordingly our net unrealized investment gain decreased from $2.2 billion after-tax as of year-end to $1.8
billion after-tax at March 31.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

to $0.85 per share.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
We have increased dividends every year for the past 16 years.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Dividend payments provide a reliable
stream of income to the millions of individuals who own our shares as part of 401(k)s other retirement accounts or as part
of overall financial planning.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Given the current environment we thought some additional commentary regarding our overall balance sheet strength and
our liquidity position would be appropriate.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
As we've said for many years we measure success over time.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And as a result
our capital management and investment strategies are designed to withstand the periods of stress that will inevitably
arise.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"To that end we closed the first quarter with over $100 billion in total assets including a $77 billion investment
portfolio.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As illustrated on Page 8 of the webcast presentation our high-quality portfolio consists of 94% fixed income
securities.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And of those fixed maturity assets 98% are investment grade.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The fixed income portfolio provides a significant
and reliable stream of income for us.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Page 9 of the presentation provides a view of our municipal bond investments.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As you can see that $31 billion portfolio
consists of extremely high-quality holdings.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Page 10 of the webcast shows our nonmunicipal fixed income holdings in
categories of particular interest given the economic impact of COVID-19.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The aggregate of our high-yield holdings in
these categories accounts for less than 1% of our fixed income portfolio.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Importantly where we do have holdings in any
particular category of $400 million or more those are investment-grade holdings of high-quality names as detailed in
the notes to the right of the graph.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Page 11 of the webcast shows the makeup of our nonfixed income portfolio which
represents only 6% of our total investment portfolio.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"These investments are highly diversified with minimal exposure to those risk categories that are most vulnerable to the
effects of COVID-19.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Our thoughtful debt-to-capital mix has only $500 million of upcoming debt maturity in November
of this year.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
After that we have no debt maturing until 2026.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Our cash and short-term investments provide us with
substantial readily available liquidity and that's not counting our undrawn $1 billion credit facility or our capital or our
capacity to issue additional commercial paper.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We stress-tested our cash flows and liquidity under a variety of scenarios
considering this uncertain environment and we're confident that we are well positioned to continue to meet our obligations
to our customers our distribution partners and our employees and to continue to support our communities.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
In terms of capital management our strategy remains unchanged.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Thinking about share buybacks in the current uncertain
environment it feels to us like holding on to a little more capital is preferable to holding on to a little less similar to how
we felt in 2008.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Accordingly we may buy back some shares in the coming quarters or we may choose to buy none until
there's more clarity on the state of the economy.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Finally let me take a minute to address outlook.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Looking at premium volume for the remainder of the year we expect to

"And because earned
premium typically lags written premium we'll continue to feel the effects on an earned basis beyond the end of the year.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As Alan said how much and for how long will depend on the extent and duration of the negative economic impacts related
to the pandemic.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As you've seen in our 10-Q we have not provided forward-looking information about pricing levels or
underlying underwriting margins given the increased level of uncertainty in the current environment.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As an aside over the past year or so we have discussed with a number of our shareholders whether there are other more
constructive ways to provide our qualitative and directional views of the business going forward as compared to the form
in which we have given it historically.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Once the current uncertainty subsides we will consider whether and how to share our perspectives going forward.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Let
me sum up what you've heard across Alan's comments and mine to give you some texture as you think about our second
quarter.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We expect downward pressure on both written and earned premiums and there will be downward pressure on
net investment income.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
We expect both of these impacts to be pronounced in the second quarter.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"There will likely be an
increase in the expense ratio due to the premium decline.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We did not have clarity on the underlying combined ratio due to
uncertainty around variations in frequency and severity for each product line.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And keep in mind that the second quarter is
historically our highest cat quarter.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski
Executive VP & President of Business Insurance

and collaboration we have witnessed among our field organization and distribution partners to continue to deliver the
exceptional support our business owner customers have come to expect.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"While we have many examples one that I'm proud to highlight is our risk control organization's ability to continue
to support new business opportunities while not always being able to perform on-site assessments.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Through the
combination of third-party data and remote-enabled technology we've increased our virtual risk assessments by more
than 4.5x from pre-COVID levels.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"These virtual capabilities have allowed us to continue to support our agents and
brokers while not compromising our risk selection.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
On to results for the first quarter.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Business Insurance produced segment income of $289 million and a combined ratio
of 102.2% both unfavorable to the prior year quarter primarily due to higher catastrophe losses and from the impact of
COVID-19.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The combined ratio included a 5-point impact from catastrophes which was higher than we had seen for the
quarter driven particularly by tornado and hail losses from cat 16 which had a heavy mix of commercial losses for us in
Nashville Tennessee.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The underlying combined ratio of 97.3% was 2.3 points higher than the prior year quarter driven
by approximately 2 points related to the coronavirus and related economic impacts.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Of this amount about 1.5 point affects
the loss ratio and about 0.5 point affects the expense ratio.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to the top line.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Net written premiums were up 1% over the prior year quarter.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"This is a lower growth rate than
what we've seen over the past few quarters with a couple of factors contributing.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"First it is a lower level of new business
which I'll touch on in a few moments when I discuss production.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In addition international written premiums were down
8% driven by Lloyd's primarily as a result of continued profit improvement initiatives.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Lastly audit premium although
still positive was lower as compared to last year.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"While we will always remain active in the marketplace premium levels
will be an outcome of disciplined underwriting and risk selection as we pursue appropriate financial returns across the
portfolio.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to domestic production.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We achieved strong renewal premium change of 7.8% including renewal rate change
of 6.2% while retention remained high at 84%.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The renewal rate change of 6.2% was up more than 1 point from the
fourth quarter of 2019 and more than 4 points from the first quarter of 2019 notwithstanding the persistent downward
pressure in workers' compensation pricing.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As part of our efforts to achieve target returns we continue to achieve higher
rate levels broadly across our book as rate increases in all lines outside of workers' comp were meaningfully higher during
the quarter as compared to both the fourth quarter and first quarters of last year.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In addition we achieved positive rate
at about 3/4 of our middle market accounts this quarter which was up from about 2/3 in the same quarter of last year.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Importantly we've achieved this progress while retention has remained strong.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Our rate strategy is to continue to be
thoughtful and execute in a local and granular manner.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"You may have noticed in our webcast presentation that RPC for prior quarters was adjusted down by as much a point or
2 driven by the exposure component.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Reestimating our production statistics is normal course for us as consumer activity
and/or changes in economic factors can form our estimates of ultimate exposure change.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So while our process was
unchanged the impact was more meaningful than normal this quarter given the significant economic effects of COVID-19
on our customers' operations.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As for the individual businesses in select renewal premium change was 5.8% including
renewal rate change of 1.6% which was up 1 point from the first quarter of last year.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Retention was relatively consistent at
81%.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
New business of $120 million was down 6% from the prior year driven primarily by lower workers' comp pricing.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In middle market renewal premium change was 7.5% with renewal rate change of 6.6% each measure up significantly
from both the fourth quarter and first quarter of last year while retention remained high at 86%.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"New business of $283
million was down from the prior year quarter which we attribute largely to our disciplined underwriting and pricing.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We're
very comfortable with our execution and we continue to invest in our strategic capabilities and are confident that we're
well positioned to profitably grow over time.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
To sum up this is certainly an unprecedented market environment we're operating in.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We believe our meaningful
competitive advantages including our strong distribution relationships and our talent and expertise position us well to
navigate through these uncertain times and continue to serve our customers and agent and broker partners.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

including medical professionals first responders and all essential workers who more than anyone are making it possible

"A special thanks also to our agents and my Travelers
colleagues who have been unrelentingly dedicated throughout the pandemic quarantine.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to the quarter Bond & Specialty delivered another quarter of very strong returns and growth.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Segment income
was $122 million a decrease of $16 million from the prior year quarter.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The combined and underlying combined ratios
remained very strong.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
The underlying combined ratio of 85.7% increased 4.6 points from the prior year quarter.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"This
increase was driven by the impact of higher loss estimates for management liability coverages primarily the impact of
COVID-19 and related economic conditions.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to the top line.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Net written premiums were up 13% for the quarter reflecting growth across all our businesses.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In our domestic management liability business we're pleased that pricing again improved for the third consecutive
quarter to a strong 7.5% while retention remained at a historically high 89%.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"These production results demonstrate the
strong execution of our strategy to improve margins while maintaining strong retention of our high-quality portfolio.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We
will continue to pursue price increases where warranted.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Domestic management liability new business for the quarter
increased 5% to $58 million.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Our domestic surety business posted very strong growth in the quarter driven by a mix of
larger bonded projects as well as a modest increase in construction activity.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"International also posted very strong growth and significantly improved pricing in the quarter driven by our U.K.
management liability business.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
So Bond & Specialty results remained strong in the quarter.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And while there is clearly the
potential for elevated loss activity in certain Bond & Specialty lines and the depth and duration of the associated economic
disruption are unknown we continue to feel great about the disciplined risk management and underwriting integrity that
shaped our portfolios our ongoing strong field execution and our strategic investments in market-leading products and
services and we feel we are well positioned to navigate through this challenging environment and continue to deliver
strong returns over time.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And now I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Michael Frederick Klein
Executive VP & President of Personal Insurance
Thank you Tom and good morning everyone.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Personal Insurance began 2020 with strong profitability and production.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Segment income was $336 million up 21% compared to the first quarter of 2019.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Our combined ratio of 88.2% improved
by approximately 2 points driven by better underlying underwriting results partially offset by lower net favorable prior
year reserve development and higher catastrophe losses.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"On an underlying basis the combined ratio was 84% an
improvement of 5 points compared to a strong prior year quarter with excellent results in both home and auto.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
The net impact from COVID-19 on segment income was not significant in the quarter.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Increases in the allowance for
credit losses on premium receivables and higher loss estimates in homeowners and other primarily from special event
coverages for wedding were offset by favorable impacts on auto loss experience that we began to see in the latter portion
of March.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to the top line.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Net written premium grew 8% driven by strong growth in domestic results especially in
homeowners.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"International net written premiums were down 5% primarily as a result of continued auto profit improvement
actions in Canada.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Agency Automobile delivered another impressive quarter with a combined ratio of 89.4% consistent
with the prior year quarter.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Underlying results improved relative to the prior year quarter while favorable net prior year
reserve development was lower than last year.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The underlying combined ratio of 89.2% improved 2.9 points relative to
the prior year quarter continuing to reflect improvements in frequency levels.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Roughly half of the improvement reflects the
continuation of the lower claim frequency levels we had already been observing while the other half is associated with a
decrease in miles driven as a result of COVID-19 and related economic conditions.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"To add some texture to the impacts of COVID-19 data from our telematics program which we call IntelliDrive indicates
a fairly rapid decline in miles driven per day during the latter part of March resulting in an average decrease of more
than 40% in miles driven for the second half of the month.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As a result auto claim frequency dropped well below our
expectations.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

quarter.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

points from the prior year quarter to 84.2% despite higher catastrophes and net prior year reserve development that while
favorable was lower than the prior year quarter.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"On an underlying basis the combined ratio was 74.9% an improvement of almost 8 points versus the prior year quarter
driven by lower noncatastrophe weather.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

lower freeze-related claims.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to production.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Agency Automobile net written premiums grew 3% with 10% growth in new business while
retention remained strong at 84% and renewal premium change was 2.4%.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

very strong quarter with net written premium growth of 18%.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

Retention remained strong at 86% and renewal premium change increased for the fifth consecutive quarter to 7.7%.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

"Now available
in 37 markets Quantum Home 2's granular pricing segmentation customizable coverages and ease of quoting combined
to form a solution that is both sophisticated and simple and our increased quote volume and higher average premiums

"Before I conclude I'd like to highlight a few examples of how our investments and capabilities are paying dividends for
us our agents and our customers in this challenging environment.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"First our digital claim capabilities are supporting
our ability to respond to customers in their time of need while keeping them and our employees safe.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"From the end of
February to the first week in April the use of virtual inspection and damage measurement for auto claims and the use
of live video inspection for property interior claims more than doubled.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Second the take-up rate in our auto telematics
program IntelliDrive is on the rise as consumers show increased interest in products that determine premiums based on
driving behavior.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And finally the digital tools we've invested in to support our agents and brokers are in high demand.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Their usage of
our digital marketing campaigns including a handful of new ones developed specifically in response to COVID-19 has
increased more than 50%.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
To recap we're thankful in Personal Insurance to have had a great start to the year.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

also grateful for the support that essential workers first responders and health care workers are providing to us and our
communities in this challenging environment.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

has responded to our customers and distribution partners while also taking care of themselves their loved ones and one
another.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

I think my first question is probably for Greg.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Look we see -- if you ex out the COVID your BI margin was relatively flat
in the quarter.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Your rates -- renewal rate was still up and accelerated.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I guess given -- and we hear you what's happening
clearly with exposures in the near term.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But I guess how do you think about how the margin should play out in the near
term?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I guess specifically I'm thinking what are your thoughts on continued ability to push for rate in the near term on
your commercial lines of the business?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

Michael so let me actually start.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And if Greg has got anything to add we'll turn it over to him.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So I think for all the reasons
that since we -- all of us have expressed in one form or another the outlook for margin is uncertain.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And I agree with you.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Margin for first quarter were actually quite good.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"From a pricing perspective I can tell you that we will continue to execute
to meet our objectives.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And on many lines that means we will continue to get rate.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Now there will be some conversation
about what customers can tolerate in times like this.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But I can tell you that customers may benefit as exposure declines
lead to premium declines.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But on those accounts where we need to improve returns we wouldn't expect premiums to
decline as much as exposure will decline.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
So in that environment that would lead to an improved price per unit if you will.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So we will continue to execute to meet
our target returns.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And obviously we'll see what happens.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
But we're coming off a pretty good trend.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

reasons that are probably apparent there are a lot of lines out there that continue to need margin improvement.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

I guess let me -- my second question will be more specifically on your commercial auto book.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

there at the very -- on personal auto how you see frequency down in the back half of March about 40% or so.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

that look for your commercial auto book?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

"Yes we're obviously watching and monitoring the trends and it's really early in terms of watching
the frequency on the commercial auto book.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But Michael and my team and the group of actuaries are spending a lot of
time at a geographic level at a business unit level and calibrating where the frequency is.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But it's just too early to really
comment on what the frequency would look like for commercial auto at this point.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer

the exact relationship will be relative to personal auto that we'll have to see how it plays out.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

In the prepared remarks you talked about certain states for workers' comp instituting presumptions of compensability.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Could you elaborate?,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Is this something that Travelers and the industry is accepting?,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Or is this -- could play out similar
to business interruption insurance or certain of these changes could kind of play out in the courts?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And I just -- is this
expected to negatively impact margins per comp in the near term?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And then you -- I think Alan you alluded to pricing
changing eventually to account for these changes?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Any clarity would help.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

Chairman & CEO
Yes sure.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Good morning.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Thanks for the question.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So I would say broadly speaking the answer to your question is it's
early and this is still developing.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
There are some number of states that have adopted some type of presumption.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In many
cases that applies to health care workers and first responders where who might have expected in any event that there
would be compensability.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In other states either they have or are talking about extending the scope of the -- essentially
compensability to other workers.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And so in effect that would shift the burden of proof to who's got to prove the way the
disease was contracted.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
In terms of exactly how it's going to play out I think we'll have to see.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In some states the business communities that are
thinking about what that's going to do to their premiums are engaging in the debate along with other interested parties.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But
exactly how it's going to play out I don't know.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I mean if it were to move against us we would expect that there would be
an impact on margins in -- over the near term.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And then obviously that will work its way into rate making over time.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG Research Division
Okay.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Great.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And lastly in terms of the surety line which you guys provide some helpful color on could you explain how
the force majeure will help out?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And is this the main line within the bond and surety segment that you expect to potentially
be most impacted?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Or are there -- or is it more the management liability side or both?,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Thomas M. Kunkel
Executive VP and President of Bond & Specialty Insurance
So thanks.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Good morning it's Tom.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I would say that when you look at the surety lines construction surety is about
2% of the revenue and commercial surety is about 1/3 of the revenue.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So we're going to focus on that bigger piece of
construction surety you asked about force majeure.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So we have force majeure clauses government action clauses
suspension of work clauses.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And as a generality as Alan pointed out in his comments we think they're going to provide
time relief in the event that contractors are delayed.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
That will be handled on a contract-by-contract basis.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

important thing when you look at the construction surety line is that it's been termed in many many and even most states
to be an essential business.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And as such it's our sense and again as Alan pointed out I think that the vast majority of contractors are still working.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And so if that's the case you would look at that construction surety business and you would say that's a healthy sign.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And
so I think when we consider the surety lines the other thing is you're going to see just a big difference amongst different
carriers.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So it's going to depend on how they underwrote their book the last 3 to 5 years and the depth and duration of any
slowdown.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
So I hope that answered your question.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer

Tom I think you said 2% construction surety I think you meant 2/3.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

I'm sorry I did mean 2/3.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

"Ronald David Bobman
Capital Returns Management LLC
And I echo your comments for everyone's well-being.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And I never thought I'd look so forward to driving to Windsor to
revisit your claims facility at some point in time.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

We look forward to having you.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Ronald David Bobman
Capital Returns Management LLC
I have 2 questions.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In the premium credit area sort of the relief that you're providing to auto -- personal auto customers
how are you handling agents' commissions on the relief?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"That was my first question and I've got an unrelated second
question.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Michael Frederick Klein
Executive VP & President of Personal Insurance
Sure.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The answer to the question on commissions this is Michael is there is no impact to base commissions from the
premium relief.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
So the agent gets paid the full commission on the policy.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Ronald David Bobman
Capital Returns Management LLC
And my other question was I made -- I took note of Alan you're specifying the virus exclusion and I greatly appreciate
that.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I just wanted to ask in the very very small segment Simply Business that I think some portion of their volume is
written using Travelers paper.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Does that virus exclusion have an explicit place there as well?,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
We don't actually have a property product on the Simply Business platform.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
So that wouldn't come into play there.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Auto Research.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
First one just on business interruption for Alan.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"First I just wanted to confirm that there's not a substantial subset or any
subset of your policies that don't have the virus exclusion?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Yes Ryan.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"When you've got a portfolio the size of ours we're certainly going to find a pocket here or there that doesn't
have that specific exclusion.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But I can tell you that subject to some legislative action that we think would be subject to a
constitutional challenge.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
We really do not think we have a material exposure from business interruption.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
And for property in the international book there's no difference of the wording issue there?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  APR 21 2020
Yes that's a really good question.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"There's definitely a difference of the way the wording and the product works outside
of the United States.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
I'm not a coverage expert and definitely not the right one to explain the nuances to you.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But I can
tell you if we get to the same conclusion outside the United States as we do inside the United States we just do not think
we've got a material exposure to business interruption.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
Okay.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And then my follow-up was just on the workers' comp and the discussion around I guess essential employees.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
You said you don't have much exposure to the frontline workers or health care.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I'm curious if you can maybe quantify that
a bit.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But then thinking about I guess other subsets that have been deemed essential that aren't necessarily health care
first responders.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
You start thinking about kind of utility workers food.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Any help I guess you could give us there on the
size of that book in the context of what you're writing?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
There's nothing we could really quantify for you.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I can tell you as it relates to health care and first responders from a
premium perspective it's a pretty small percentage of the workers' comp premiums that we have.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Then once you start
getting outside of that every state defines essential a little bit different and so it's -- we are -- we will definitely have
exposure to essential workers.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Then you get into questions of okay so what are the infection rates going to be?,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"What
are the health care costs et cetera et cetera?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But there's really nothing -- there's really no number we can give you on an
aggregate basis I think that we have enough confidence to give you or that we think would be helpful.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
Yes.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Alan I think you've talked about the business interruption pretty well but just one other just quick clarification.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Do
you all provide a virus endorsement to customers at all?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And if so what percentage of your policies would you provide that
endorsement?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So this is across Travelers basis there are a few number of policies that do have an affirmative virus grant and
losses for that would be included in our results for this quarter.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So we would have contemplated that in the charge that we
took.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
Excellent.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Great.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
That's really really helpful.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And then second question I'm just curious.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Do you all -- and this is for Tom
do you all participate at all in the energy surety market?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And if so what are your expectations there?,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Thomas M. Kunkel
Executive VP and President of Bond & Specialty Insurance
Well in our commercial surety business we do have a modest participation in the surety business.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"There you see lots of
different parts of that market from upstream to mid-stream the downstream the service providers we have some parts
of that market that over the years we have liked better than others.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"However I think our approach to the energy market
has always been somewhat cautious and while we certainly do have a modest exposure there we're not out-weight in any
way shape or form.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  APR 21 2020
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
So if I take $86 million that you guys called out for COVID in the quarter and that's around 1.2 points on your combined
ratio.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And so I guess my question is that was for 1 month right or about 1 month for March is the right way to think about
it?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
And I understand you guys don't want to go down the front of giving full guidance.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Is the right way to think about it that
we would make that -- take that for the full quarter and some kind of math of times 3 or some assumption of how long we
think the COVID impact will last within the industry?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Daniel Stephen Frey
Executive VP & CFO
Elyse it's Dan Frey.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
I'll try to take that.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
I think that would be very difficult to do for a couple of reasons.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"One is part of the
charge as we explained in my commentary relates to bad debt provision for billing relief and billing relief we expect to
occur for a finite period of time.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"That's going to be based on what we've already announced voluntarily and in some cases
what states are asking us to do.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
But right now that's pretty boxed.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And so we think that we would have most of that inside
what we've seen so far.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So far I'd say there could be more of that in the second quarter but I certainly wouldn't take that
number times 12.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Unless of course this becomes a prolonged and deep situation in which that situation has to continue
on a go-forward basis.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I think similarly some of the losses that we've talked about as Tom just talked about we tried to make -- as Alan just
talked about sorry we try to make an assessment of where we think we do have some potential exposure outside the
U.S. and try to be fully responsive in that regard.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
So it would be -- I think too early to one to make a conclusion.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And two
I would counsel I think against that approach.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
Okay.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
That's helpful.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And then my second question on in the 10-Q you guys had called out some prior year adjustments
within Business Insurance I believe for the fourth quarter of last year.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Is it possible to quantify that?,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And what lines that
stem from?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
It seems like it was offset by other kind of development pushes and pulls.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Daniel Stephen Frey
Executive VP & CFO
I'm not sure what the question is Elyse.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Could you give me some help on specifically what you're talking about?,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
I thought I saw a comment in the 10-Q in relation to Business Insurance where you guys had called out some adverse
development for the -- later in the 2019 accident year.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Was there any kind of true-ups or adverse development taken
on some of the longer tail lines whether commercial auto or general liability related to accident year 2019 within just
Business Insurance?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Daniel Stephen Frey
Executive VP & CFO
Yes.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So if it's in the commentary in the MD&A around the change in the underlying combined ratio in Business Insurance
we do have the impact of the changes in the liability lines that we reported in the second third and fourth quarters of last
year and disclosed in last year's quarter.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Now when you look at those they carry forward and have an impact on the first
quarter of this year.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
It was not included in the first quarter of last year.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
So that's the delta we're trying to explain there.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
But Elyse if you're -- you may be asking about prior year development.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
I think that's what you said.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But Elyse maybe we
can take this off-line.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
I think we're a little confused about the question.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

"Can you talk -- you mentioned your views on business interruption
just your views on the legality of claims in some cases.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
But can you talk about submission activity for the line?,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

many claims you're seeing filed versus what you'd normally see file in a normal quarter just to get an idea on how much
litigation there could be in this line?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

"So whether or not the...
Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
Broadly speaking workers' compensation claim frequency would be down.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Our -- I probably wouldn't want to quantify
that because I'm not sure we'd want to say what we've seen in a couple of weeks is necessarily going to translate to what
we're going to see for a full quarter.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But across many of our lines of business we've seen frequency -- claim frequency
down.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
I'm not sure that necessarily translates into litigation risk however if that's the point that you're trying to make.,2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Jamminder Singh Bhullar

Sorry on business interruption I might have said workers' comp but business interruption.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Business interruption I'm sorry.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"There's definitely been some claim activity the -- and essentially everyone where I'd
say the vast majority of them we declined it because we've got the exclusion or other provisions that apply.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So I don't --
I actually don't even know what the precise number is.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But the vast majority we declined the claim consistent with the
policy terms.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Jamminder Singh Bhullar

And then how does your reinsurance clause coverage work in the sense that if you are -- if you end up losing some cases
in court on business interruption is your reinsurance plan going to cover you regardless of whether you have losses or
not?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Or the language is such that your primary losses or losses on the primary side will not be covered by reinsurance
because those contracts have specific virus clauses as well?",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"It's always a mistake I think to give claim advice on either side of the insurance policy without specific facts and
circumstances and looking at the policy language.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But to be responsive to your question I will say that the follow-the-
fortunes doctrine is alive and well and reflected in our reinsurance treaties generally.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt
"That being said if there is legislative
action that essentially overturns contract certainty and we end up in constitutional challenges et cetera then we're in a
new world and I'm not sure what happens to reinsurance in that situation.",2020-3-31 Travelers Transcript.txt

COVID-19 is an event of historic proportions impacting societies and economies globally.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

businesses and individuals hard and the impact will be with us for some time.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Chubb has and is performing well while
naturally shouldering our burden of responsibility supporting our insureds our businesses and consumers.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"COVID-19 is a
slow-rolling global catastrophe impacting virtually all countries.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Unlike other natural catastrophes it has no geographic or
time limits and the event continues as we speak.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Together the health and consequent economic crisis will likely produce
the largest loss in insurance history particularly considering its worldwide scope and how both sides of the balance sheet
are ultimately impacted.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We preannounced a few weeks ago an after-tax COVID-related loss estimate of $1.2 billion which essentially cost us
1/4 of earnings.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"This loss is an estimate of our ultimate loss from the pandemic an economic crisis based on everything
we know and can project.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The estimate does not included for the most part a credit for potentially lower current accident
year losses from a decrease in exposures except for a very modest amount.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Looking beyond this quarter's catastrophe
losses and the shadow it cast is an important story to tell about our company.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Our underlying health and vitality are
excellent.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
And we are capitalizing on current industry commercial P&C conditions.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Our published P&C combined ratio was 112.3 with the total after-tax cash charge of $1.5 billion including $353 million of
natural catastrophe and civil unrest-related losses.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Separately we took an after-tax charge of $205 million in unfavorable
prior period development for child molestation-related claims emerging predominantly from reviver statutes that came into
effect last year.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
If anybody's moving papers stop it.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

prior.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

"Phil will have more to say about investment income
book value cats and prior period development.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
Broadly speaking 2 themes impacted growth in the quarter.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"On the one hand shrinking exposures from the decline
in economic activity weighed negatively on growth; and on the other hand favorable commercial P&C underwriting
conditions contributed to growth.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
In the quarter P&C net premiums grew 1.4% in constant dollars.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Growth was
impacted due to a onetime charge we took to estimate the ultimate impact on premiums that we will incur from exposure
adjustments on in-force policies due to a reduction in economic activity.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Excluding the charge which is a better way of
viewing our underlying quarterly growth we grew 3.9%.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

P&C and 6.3% negative growth in consumer lines which includes A&H travel and personal lines.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

geography and product line.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

"In North America which
includes the U.S. Canada and Bermuda commercial P&C net premiums grew 10% adjusting for the onetime premium

safety and quality in our high net worth segment.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

in its inability to manage the health crisis on a national basis.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

which purchased BI coverage that does not provide cover for pandemic and these customers are understandably
disappointed and upset.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Pointless attorneys are attempting to torture or reverse engineer insurance contract language to
conjure up business interruption coverage that for the most part simply doesn't exist.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Coverage for pandemic was never
contemplated in standard business interruption policies.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
And therefore no premiums were ever charged for that risk.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"In fact state insurance regulators who approved the policies have been clear that this risk is not covered and that
the industry could not cover the massive open-ended tail risk of a global pandemic because it threatens the industry's
solvency.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Without the federal government playing a major role to cover the tail risk pandemics are simply under
uninsurable on a broad basis.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Standard BI policies which are an addendum to a fire policy required direct physical loss or damage to the property
for example a fire or flood damages the property and prevents the business from operating while repairs are being
made.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"COVID-19 does not cause physical loss or damage to a property despite the trial bars' efforts to influence some
government officials in the wording of their civil public shutdown orders.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"But what doesn't cover pandemic standard BI
coverage provides good value for the money.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We estimate the industry pays out about $0.70 in insurance claims for every
business interruption production dollar collected with most of the remaining amount trading commissions premium taxes
and other expenses.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"For Chubb in addition to our normal losses this year we will pay BI claims for policies that specifically covered certain
pandemic-related shutdowns such as those for the entertainment industry.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We care deeply about properly supporting
and servicing all of our policyholders.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And I have particularly -- particular sympathy for the millions of businesses that
have suffered terribly during the pandemic towards economic shutdowns.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"But it would be wrong in fact catastrophic and
irresponsible to pay the claims of those who didn't have coverage and in fact didn't pay premiums with the coverage by
using funds that have been properly reserved for the legitimate claims of the vast majority of our P&C policyholders who
number over 100 million globally.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
To provide some context in 2009 -- 2019 Chubb paid $24 billion on approximately 4 million property and casualty claims.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Again to pay billions of dollars in uncovered claims by rating the reserves or capital needed to pay claims on other kinds
of policies such as auto and home commercial insurance exposures respond to natural catastrophes such as hurricanes
and wildfires would be irresponsible to the vast majority of our policyholders and to our shareholders.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Beyond the business interruption challenges of the current COVID-19 crisis the insurance industry has an important
role to play in society and in the economy and that includes fully participating in the development of a prospective
future pandemic business interruption solution to crises arise.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Earlier this month Chubb released its pandemic business
interruption program designed to mitigate the economic disruption and losses in the event of a future pandemic.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Our
framework is not the first plan to be introduced but the public-private partnership framework we developed has important
differences from the other leading proposals.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"By sharing our ideas and approach we hope to spark and influence a
productive debate on a solution that will work for businesses of all sizes taxpayers our industry and the economy more
broadly.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
First and foremost I believe the industry can and should take pandemic risk along with the government.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"This is a peril that
can be covered to a greater degree than we do today as long as the tail exposure is covered by the government.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"It is our
job to figure out how to do that.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We can do more than simply play an administrative role where we belittle ourselves and
we're less relevant than we can or should be.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
The framework we announced has attributes that we believe will make for a successful program.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"It accounts for the
different needs of small medium and to a modest degree large businesses.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Premium for small business will be
affordable and they will be paid quickly.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Large companies would pay a fair and risk-adjusted price to both the government
insurers for pandemic cover and a program built on free market principles.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The government gets paid for the use of its
balance sheet not a handout to larger companies.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
Our framework has incentives for broad participation by the industry.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And by committing insurance industry capital and providing opportunity for increased risk sharing over time as direct and
secondary markets develop the pandemic burden shouldered by the government will ultimately be lessened to a degree.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
This is an important issue for our nation.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We look forward to contributing to the dialogue as policymakers work to refine
the most effective solution.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
Before I turn the things over to Phil I want to say a few words about an issue that concerns all of us.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

"We want to actively
support each other.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"It starts with more frank dialogue between our employees of color particularly black colleagues and
our white colleagues to create better understanding and awareness about the realities of racism.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"We'll hold leaders more
accountable for curating and leading an environment of inclusion and we'll eliminate policies and practices that potentially
create bias and inhibit our ability to create greater racial mix of our workforce at all levels of the company.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

enduring process not a momentary event in time.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

"In the
quarter we returned $353 million to shareholders in dividends.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Adjusted net investment income for the quarter of $857

Our share book and tangible book value were up 4.9% and 7.2% respectively in the quarter.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Our core operating loss and dividend payment were more than offset by net realized and unrealized gains for the

currency movements and a $110 million mark-to-market gain in our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

Evan thanks for all those comments especially on the BI stuff and appreciate that.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"I guess can you talk about the impact
that COVID and shelter in place is having on your acquisition expense ratio?",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And then longer term maybe you've made
some good strides in your expense ratio in general even prior to COVID.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

run rate going forward from there?",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman President & CEO
Yes.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
Let's see.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
The acquisition ratio benefits fundamentally from a mix of business change.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"You had consumer lines that
as I said had a negative growth to them and they run a higher acquisition cost than commercial P&C does.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And we're
growing underneath as you could see commercial P&C at a rapid clip and it has a lower acquisition ratio.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"The OpEx ratio
did benefit reasonably well in the quarter from COVID-related shutdown.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And I expect that we'll continue to receive benefit
from that as we go forward in future quarters.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And so overall I think the expense ratio will continue to benefit in future
quarters.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
How much and to what degree I'm not going to prognosticate or give guidance on.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

That's helpful.,2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

"Can you talk
about what specific lines maybe benefit the most from frequency benefits?",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt
"And then with some of the reopenings we've

of the reopenings?",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

"On the other hand we took a massive charge
to recognize the COVID-related claims that will arise.",2020-6-30 Chubb Transcript.txt

"[Operator
Instructions] As a reminder this conference is being recorded on July 23 2020.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Ms. Glodstein please go ahead.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Abbe F. Goldstein
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Good morning and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our second quarter 2020 results.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We released our
press release financial statement and webcast presentation earlier this morning.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"All of these materials can be found on
our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 segment
Presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Tom Kunkel of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of
Personal Insurance.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"They will
refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Before I turn the call over to Alan I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast
presentation.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The company cautions investors that any
forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Actual results
may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"These
factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-
K filed with the SEC.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Also in our remarks or responses to questions we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Reconciliations are
included in our recent earnings press release financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section
on our website.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
And now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Thank you Abbe.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As we shared in our pre-release last week
and again this morning we reported a small net loss for the quarter due to a high level of catastrophe losses and as we
expected a loss in our non-fixed income investment portfolio.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Dan will have more to say about both shortly.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Our underlying underwriting income of $572 million pretax was up $254 million over the prior year quarter benefiting from
solid net earned premium and a 3.5 point improvement in the underlying combined ratio to a strong 91.4%.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The pandemic
and related economic conditions had only a modest net impact on our underwriting results.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As I shared in my prepared
remarks last quarter there will be COVID-19-related loss activity but there will be some offsetting decline in losses due to
people across the country sheltering in place.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"For us in the quarter $114 million of direct losses and $63 million of audit premium adjustments were about offset by
initial estimates of favorable loss activity most of which is in short-tail lines.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Given the continued uncertainty we've taken
a cautious approach to recognizing the net impact of COVID-19-related loss activity.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Some industry observers have speculated about the aggregate level of insured and investment losses arising out of the
pandemic.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
We don't doubt the losses will be significant but they won't be borne evenly across insurers.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Our manageable
COVID-related insurance losses so far this year are a reflection of our disciplined approach to risk selection as well as
terms and conditions.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And as we shared with you in some detail last quarter we managed our investment portfolio with a
similar regard to balancing risk and reward.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES INC. FQ2 2020 EARNINGS CALL  JUL 23 2020
Last quarter I commented on the potential future impacts the pandemic might have on each of our key lines of business.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
I'll review that again with a quarter's worth of experience.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In personal auto we've seen a meaningful drop-off in auto
frequency although that is moderating as economic activity picks up.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"At the same time we've taken into consideration the
potential for some offsetting impact in terms of auto severity due to factors such as collisions occurring at higher speeds
and driver distraction.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In workers' compensation COVID-related claims mostly relate to health care workers and first responders which do not
represent a significant part of our book of business.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Also the frequency of those claims stabilized during the quarter
which might be attributed to an improved supply of PPE and the health care community having the benefit of more
experience with managing COVID patients.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"More probably beyond the health care sector data from some of the state workers' comp systems suggests that the
COVID-related claim rate is low relative to the infection rate.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"That's likely partly attributable to the fact that the population
most seriously affected by COVID-19 skews older and is not the workforce.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Nonetheless in developing our loss estimates we've taken into consideration the potential for the delayed reporting of
claims and additional claim activity associated with recent spike in infection rates as well as uncertainty related to the
longer-term implications of the disease.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As we anticipated some states have effectively expanded the scope of workers' comp coverage by creating presumptions
of compensability.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In most cases states have taken a thoughtful approach protecting workers appropriately but not
unreasonably burdening the workers' compensation system.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Where states have acted to expand compensability we've
adjusted our loss estimates accordingly.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In terms of non-COVID workers' comp losses we've seen the lower volume of workers' comp claims as workers have
stayed home.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
This will abate as people get back to the workplace.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In addition to taking that into account we have
contemplated that severity could be adversely affected by injured workers delaying treatment due to the stay-at-home
work environment.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Having said all that our experience is that there's a low level of workers' comp claim activity associated
with economic recessions.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"During periods of elevated unemployment workers tend to be more motivated to stay at their
jobs and the workforce tends to be more seasoned.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In management liability as we expected we are seeing the elevated level of claim activity typically associated with stock
market volatility and workforce reductions.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The underlying combined ratio this quarter in Bond & Specialty reflects that
as well as other loss activity and we expect that the underlying combined ratio will continue to be elevated at this level
or somewhat higher over the near term.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"This is not the likely experience we had in the aftermath of the financial crisis a
decade ago.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Nonetheless we expect the return from this segment will continue to be healthy.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to the surety business.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We've been pleased to see that work is continuing on the vast majority of construction
projects.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
However the depth and duration of stressing the economy continues to be risk factors of the surety business.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
The line will also be impacted by other factors such as the financial strength in the bonded firms.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As I shared last quarter our high-quality surety book was effectively stress-tested in the 2008 financial crisis and
performed well and our underwriting approach has remained disciplined since that time.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In that regard so far we haven't
seen anything that has caused us to change our surety loss estimates.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In terms of business interruption coverages under commercial property policies there's a fair amount of litigation
challenging coverage.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As a reminder our commercial property insurance policies that include business interruption
including as a result of similar authority require losses to be caused by direct fiscal damage to property from a covered
cause of loss.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In addition our standard policy forms specifically exclude loss or damage caused by or resulting from
a virus.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"A few core decisions we've seen so far one in New York and one in Michigan have both upheld the physical
damage requirements in the context of COVID-19.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
On the legislative front efforts to retroactively expand coverage for business interruption seem to be diminishing.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Finally
with respect to liability coverages.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As people shelter in place we are seeing fewer commercial auto accidents and slip-
and-fall type claims.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Anecdotally we are also seeing some movement by the Plaintiffs' Bar to settle claims faster but it's
too soon to know how significant that benefit might be.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

We're also encouraged by states that have adopted COVID-related liability protections and similar efforts that are
underway in other states and at the federal level.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
We shouldn't let frivolous lawsuits undermine the nation's recovery.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Nonetheless we expect the Plaintiffs' Bar to continue to be active.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to the quarter on the top line we're very pleased with our production results.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Excluding the auto premium refunds
we provided to our customers net written premiums grew by 2% as the impact of COVID-19 on insured exposures was
more than offset by strong renewal rate change in all 3 segments.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In Business Insurance we achieved renewal rate change of 7.4% the highest level since 2013 and close to the record
level we achieved that year.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Excluding workers' comp renewal rate change was double digits.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Importantly retention levels
remained strong.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In Bond & Specialty Insurance net written premiums increased by 3% as our domestic management liability business
achieved record renewal rate change while maintaining strong retention.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In Personal Insurance excluding the other
premium refunds net written premiums increased by 6% driven by strong retention and new business in both agency
auto and agency homeowners.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In our agency homeowners business renewal premium change remained strong at 7.7%
and we hit a record for new business.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Let me take a minute to comment on the commercial rate environment.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Before the pandemic struck there were a number
of industry-wide factors putting upward pressure on prices namely increased volatility of weather-related losses interest
rates at historical lows and a growing recognition of higher loss trend in the liability lines.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"All of those conditions persist
and now at another quarter with a very high level of weather-related losses interest rates that are likely to be lower for
longer and while it hasn't been a significant factor for us the reinsurance market that is hardened.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And on top of that the
pandemic and related economic fallout add a sense of incremental uncertainty making this feel like one of those times
not unlike in the wake of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina when the market recalibrates risk.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"With that as the background we'll
continue to seek rate gains and manage other levers of profitability to improve the outlook for returns.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I'll close by saying that I couldn't be more grateful to my Travelers colleagues for their grit and commitment to taking care
of our customers our business partners our communities and each other.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Also the work they've done in recent years
to advance our innovation agenda has equipped us with state-of-the-art digital tools and other capabilities that make all
the difference in this environment we were well prepared.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
And from here we're well positioned.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Free from financial and
operational distractions we'll continue uninterrupted managing our business and investing for long-term success.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In
short we're confident in our ability to continue to succeed through these uncertain times and to benefit from the strength
of our franchise as the economy recovers.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
And with that I'll turn the call over to Dan.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

"Our core loss for the second quarter was $50 million compared to core income of $537 million in the
prior year quarter.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The change resulted primarily from a higher level of catastrophe losses and as expected lower net
investment income.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"For the quarter the net impact related to COVID-19 is included in our underlying results not as part
of our cat figure and was modest more on that in a minute.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Our second quarter results include $854 million of pretax cat
losses compared to only $367 million in last year's second quarter.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"This quarter's cats include severe storms in several
regions of the United States as well as $91 million of losses related to civil unrest.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Regarding our property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty for 2020 as of June 30 we have accumulated about $1.4
billion of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention of $1.55 billion.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The treaty provides aggregate coverage of
$280 million or $500 million of losses above that $1.55 billion retention.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The underlying combined ratio of 91.4% which
excludes the impacts of cats and PYD improved by 3.5 points compared to 94.9% in last year's second quarter.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The
underlying loss ratio improved by more than 4 points and benefited from a lower level of non-cat weather losses favorable
frequency in personal auto from the shelter-in-place environment net of related premium refunds and the impact of
earned pricing in excess of loss trend.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The expense ratio of 31% is 0.8 points higher than the prior year quarter and
above our recent run rate.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"This change was as expected due to the reduction in premiums associated with the pandemic's
impact on the economy along with the premium refunds to our personal auto customers.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The net impact of COVID-19 and
its related effects on the economy were modest in terms of our overall second quarter underwriting income.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

Our top line was resilient.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Excluding the premium refunds in Personal Insurance net written premiums increased by 2%
driven by strong renewal rate change in all 3 segments that more than offset lower insured exposures.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In terms of operating expenses results were adversely impacted by modest increases in the allowance for bad debt and
the accrual for supplemental commissions.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Those expense increases however were roughly offset by lower expenses in
other categories.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
For example travel costs were down as our employees continue to work primarily from home.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
The economic impacts related to COVID-19 also affected our underlying losses.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"For example losses directly related
to COVID-19 totaled $114 million primarily workers' comp and business insurance and management liability losses in
our Bond & Specialty business.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"On the other hand we experienced significant reductions in auto claims as there were
fewer cars on the road during the second quarter and to a lesser degree recognized a benefit reflecting fewer traditional
workers' comp claims as more people work from home.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As you heard from Alan given the uncertainty in the current environment we took a cautious approach in estimating
the net impact of COVID-related losses.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We have recorded the estimated cost for all losses incurred through June 30
including incurred losses for which claims have not yet been recorded.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"All losses have been recorded at our estimate of
ultimate and the majority of the COVID-19-related insurance losses we have booked in the first and second quarters are
still sitting in our IBNR reserves.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We have not recognized losses or benefits from COVID-19-related insured events that
we anticipate will occur subsequent to the end of the quarter.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Taking a step back on a year-to-date basis the impact on our results excluding net investment income from COVID-19
and its related effects is a net charge of about $50 million pretax.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to prior year reserve development.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In Personal insurance both auto and property losses came in better than
expected for multiple accident years.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In Bond & Specialty Insurance we saw larger losses than expected in management
liability resulting in prior year strengthening of $33 million largely offsetting the favorable development in Personal
Insurance.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In business insurance there was no net prior year reserve development as better-than-expected loss experience in
workers' comp and commercial property was largely offset by unfavorable results in our other casualty lines.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Each of the
movements this quarter was relatively small when compared to the reserve base.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As you saw in our July 14 press release
we expect to record subrogation benefits in our third quarter PYD of approximately $400 million pretax related to PG&E's
successful emergence from bankruptcy on July 1.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As a reminder third quarter PYD will also include the results of our
annual asbestos review.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"After-tax net investment income decreased by 54% from the prior year quarter to $251 million somewhat better result
than we had previewed in our call last quarter.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The decrease was driven by our non-fixed income returns where results
for our private equity hedge fund and real estate partnerships are generally reported to us on a 1-quarter lag.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Accordingly
the impact of the disruption in global financial markets that occurred in the latter half of the first quarter impacted our
second quarter results.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As the broader markets have recovered in the second quarter that should at least to some extent
benefit our non-fixed income results in the third quarter.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"It's worth mentioning here that recoveries may not be reflected in the private equity and hedge fund results as quickly as
the downturns were.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Given continued economic uncertainty the fund managers will report their results to us and may a
more measured approach and not be as quick to write back up the valuations they just marked down particularly in light
of what may be continued challenging prospects for the earnings and cash flows of the fund's underlying investments.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Fixed income returns decreased by $24 million after-tax as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more
than offset by the decline in interest rates and a mix change as we chose to maintain a somewhat higher level of liquidity
and held more short-term investments than in prior quarters.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"For the remainder of 2020 we expect that fixed income NII
will decrease by approximately $35 million to $40 million after-tax per quarter compared to the corresponding period of
2019.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to capital management.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.7 billion were again very strong all our capital
ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of slightly more than
$2 billion well above our target level.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Recall that in April we prefunded as we normally do $500 million of debt coming
due in November with a new 30-year $500 million debt issuance at 2.55%.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So our holding company liquidity is temporarily
elevated by that amount.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

economic uncertainty and with hurricane season upon us it still feels to us like holding on to a little more capital is
preferable to holding on to a little less.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

shares in the coming quarters or we may continue to choose to buy none.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Coming back to reinsurance for a moment let me direct your attention to Slide 19 of the webcast presentation for a
summary of our July 1 renewals.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The structure of our main cat reinsurance program is generally consistent with the prior
year.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We renewed our Northeast cat treaty effective July 1 with substantially similar terms and pricing that was up only
slightly on an exposure adjusted basis.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Our cat bond Long Point Re III is now in the third year of its 4-year term.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In the annual reset for the 2020 hurricane
season the attachment point was adjusted from $1.79 billion to $1.87 billion while the total cost of the program was flat
year-over-year.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage including our general cat aggregate XOL
treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences is included in our 10-Q
which we filed earlier today and in our 2019 Form 10-K.
Lastly let me take a minute to address thoughts on our top line going forward.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Looking at premium volume we expect to
experience the impacts of economic disruption.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"How much of an impact we feel and for how long will depend on the extent
and duration of the negative economic impacts related to the pandemic because earned premium typically lags written
premium we expect to feel the effects on an earned basis beyond the end of the year.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As Alan said last quarter we do not intend to take disruptive expense actions in response to what may prove to be a
short-term impact on premium volumes.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Accordingly in coming quarters the expense ratio will likely remain somewhat
elevated compared to the corresponding periods of 2019 due to the expected impact on earned premiums.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Now I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski

"Let me start by expressing my deep appreciation to all my Travelers' colleagues as well as our agent and
broker partners for continuing to provide exceptional service to our customers during these unprecedented times.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As for the quarter's results Business Insurance had a loss for the quarter of $58 million due to lower net investment
income and higher catastrophe losses as both Alan and Dan discussed.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The combined ratio of 107.1% included more
than 10 points of catastrophes impacted by both weather-related losses and civil unrest.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

97% improved by 0.4 points reflecting a 0.2 point improvement in each of the underlying loss ratio and expense ratio.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The
net impact of COVID-19 and related economic conditions was modest.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to the top line.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Net written premiums were 3% lower than the prior year quarter due to the impact of the economic
disruption on insured exposures.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Thanks to excellent execution by our field organization these impacts were largely offset
by strong renewal rate increases and high retention.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Turning to domestic production.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
We achieved strong renewal rate change of 7.4% while retention remained high at 83%.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The renewal rate change of 7.4% was up almost 4 points from the second quarter of last year and more than 1 point
from the first quarter of this year notwithstanding the persistent downward pressure in workers' compensation pricing.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We continue to achieve higher rate levels broadly across our book as rate increases in all lines other than workers'
compensation were meaningfully higher during the quarter as compared to the second quarter of last year.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We achieved
positive rate on about 80% of our Middle Market accounts this quarter which was up from about 2/3 in the second quarter
of last year.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Importantly we've achieved this progress in a highly segmented manner and with retention remaining strong.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"At these rate levels our rate change continues to exceed loss trend even after about 0.5 point increase to our loss trend
assumption.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

Segment income was $72 million a decrease of $102 million from the prior year quarter.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

compared to favorable PYD in the prior year quarter and a higher underlying combined ratio.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The underlying combined
ratio of 88.1% increased 7.1 points from the prior year quarter primarily driven by the impacts of higher loss estimates
for management liability coverages about half of which was due to COVID-19 and related economic conditions.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The
remaining half of the increase is due to a few smaller drivers such as elevated claim activity under employment practices

"This marks the seventh consecutive quarter where RPC

$10 million down from $88 million in the prior year quarter driven by a higher level of catastrophe losses and lower net
investment income.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

"Our combined ratio for the quarter was 101.3% an increase of 1.1 points and the 12.5 point increase in catastrophe
losses was largely offset by a 10.6 point improvement in the underlying combined ratio.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The underlying combined ratio
benefited from lower non-catastrophe weather-related losses and lower automobile losses net of premium refunds.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

earlier.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

improvements in frequency primarily due to fewer miles driven as a result of the pandemic.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

accordingly they will be recognized in our fourth quarter results.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
This same principle applies when we consider losses related to COVID-19.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"While only some losses have been reported

Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
I guess I want to try to get arms around business insurance and margins and pricing.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Trying to kind of pull out the effect
of COVID you said COVID was pretty modest in the quarter.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Pricing was clearly very strong.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Yes core margins improved
40 bps or 20 bps on the well side.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So I guess trying to understand does that mean -- and Alan you gave a lot of great
commentary on pricing.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Does that mean that the current level of pricing still isn't enough to expand margin today?,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Or kind
of how do we think about that versus the level of conservatism that might be baked into the current numbers?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Michael it's Alan.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
I'll start by giving you a response to what's on your mind.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"At the current levels written rate is in
excess of loss trend.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
So looking narrowly at those factors we are on a written basis expanding margins.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Is that where
you're getting at?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
It is.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Yes it is.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
I guess in business interruption you had 20 basis points of improvement.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So not as much as maybe one
would expect given a level of pricing.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
And so that's what I'm trying to get my arms around.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So as always there are a number of factors that are driving the underlying combined ratio in the quarter and that's
true for any business.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
So you've got weather.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
So year-over-year that was better.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And in this quarter sort of within the
normal -- within the normal level of variability we would expect for that.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"You've got the earned impact of rate that -- as
I said on both the written and earned basis rate is ahead of loss trend.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We've had improved performances in some
business.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
You got some impact of COVID it was modest but not 0.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"You've got the year-over-year sort of ongoing carry-
on impact of social inflation that I'll call old news what we've recognized in prior periods and that continues to roll through.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
So those are -- given the relative stability we're not going to quantify the pieces but essentially those are the pieces.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
Okay.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
That's helpful.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I guess I didn't see you mention -- and I guess this is good news didn't see you mention of anything
on the commercial auto side for PYD.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
And so maybe could you speak to kind of that piece?,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And does that mean that
there's been possibly some leveling off of the paid activity that's been part of the concern there?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Daniel Stephen Frey
Executive VP & CFO
Michael it's Dan.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Yes as we had last quarter so we had some movements in PYD some puts and takes some
continued good news in comp some continued pressure in the other liability lines.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"There were small adjustments in
commercial auto and the general liability lines in CMP.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But as I said in my remarks relatively modest compared to those
reserve bases.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

I just wanted to get a better feel for just -- forget about the net benefit from the COVID.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Just from the direct losses alone or
the direct impact what was the hit that that had in business interruption on the combined ratio?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Is this interruption specifically our Business Insurance?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
I'm sorry I'm sorry Business Insurance.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Without considering the offsetting benefits what was just the direct loss impact or
direct hit impact on that number?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Daniel Stephen Frey
Executive VP & CFO
Yes.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Ryan it's Dan.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
I don't think we're going to give the pluses and the minuses.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But within the -- we told you that there
was $114 million of directly related charges.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And while that included some charges for the management liability coverages
in Bond & Specialty the majority of what we took came through Business Insurance.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
Got it.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And then in terms of thinking about the benefits that we're seeing I think in the pre-announcement you said it
was mostly short-tail lines.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But -- so should we take that to me -- I mean first of all outside of the short-tail lines are you
seeing actual to expected look a little bit better in some areas in terms of frequency?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And is that not something -- and if
so is that something that you're not recognizing yet you're being conservative and waiting to see if that continues to be
the case?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Daniel Stephen Frey
Executive VP & CFO
Yes.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Ryan it's Dan again.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So we are for sure seeing some favorable indications relative to what you would otherwise
expect in this current environment.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And when we look at that there was too much favorability to simply say 0 is the right
reaction.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But as Alan said in his comments and as I tried to reiterate in mine I think we've been very cautious in terms of
the degree to which we recognize any good news in anything other than the short-tail lines but there's some because it's
very apparent in the data.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
And then just one more real quick.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I was I guess a little bit surprised exposure growth held in I think especially in Select
lines retention has only declined modestly.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
How should we interpret that?,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Is retention -- is it capturing cancellations?,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Or is
that modest dip mostly a function of you guys taking more rate?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I'm just trying to figure out how to interpret those numbers
that seem relatively modest given what's happening in the macro landscape.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski
Executive VP & President of Business Insurance
Yes Ryan let me take -- this is Greg.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Let me take both of those in the order that you took them.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Number one in terms of
exposure change if you're looking at relative to Middle Market that's really a product mix dynamic.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"In the Select business
we have -- the thrust of the premium is 2 products CMP and workers' comp.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And the CMP product the rating on that is
driven more off the property than the GL.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
And so we're continuing to see pricing and inflationary pressure on the property.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
And so there's some inflationary impact that that impacts on the CMP product.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And so you don't see much of a drag on
exposure on Select that you do on Middle Market where the GL product is more on a stand-alone rated basis.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And then the retention overall for Select we certainly put our estimate of what we see in terms of business insolvencies
bankruptcies and that's all inside the 82% number.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Meyer Shields
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. Research Division
Greg if I heard you correctly in your prepared comments you talked about a 50 basis point increase in loss trends.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And I
was hoping you could flesh that out a little?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski
Executive VP & President of Business Insurance
Sure Meyer.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
We look at loss trends every quarter in -- across the full portfolio and that's obviously a headline number.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"What we did this quarter as we looked at the impact of the new economy that we see in front of us we also look at some
of the social inflation or liability dynamics that Dan just talked about.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"When we roll that all up in aggregate we believe
we've got a 50 basis point increase in our loss trend in front of us.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
The thing I'd add to that Meyer is that is reflected in the underlying combined ratio we reported for the quarter as is a
piece of that that would be catch-up from the first quarter.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Meyer Shields
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. Research Division
Okay.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Perfect.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
That last point is exactly what I was looking for.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Second question I guess with workers' compensation
being the most vulnerable to exposure unit pressure does that impact rate need on the expense ratio side?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Say the question again.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Meyer Shields
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. Research Division
I'm trying to understand I know that in general workers' compensation pricing has been coming down because industry
experience has been good but we seem to be seeing a fairly significant exposure unit headwind.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And I'm trying to get my
arms around what that implies for indicated pricing.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Meyer there's a heavy regulatory component to pricing as you know and it tends to be a little bit backward-looking
and it sort of factors in the overall profitability of the line which is as you know has been very favorable over the years
and that will continue to be the case.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So clearly exposure will be one impact on profitability today which will impact
pricing tomorrow.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"But it's really hard to isolate any one factor and its impact on profitability because everything goes in
you've got -- you start with your expiring rate and then you've got whatever the rate change is and you've got exposure
change you've got loss trends things like that.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
So it's definitely a factor.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"It's hard to isolate what the extent of the impact
is.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

Sorry.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
In terms of Business Insurance I was hoping for the COVID-19 losses.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And I recognize in response from an earlier
question maybe you aren't giving just the loss impact in Business Insurance specifically by line.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So could you give us a
sense of where you saw the majority of your COVID losses that's ignoring the favorable impact in the second quarter just
specifically within Business Insurance?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski
Executive VP & President of Business Insurance
Yes Elyse.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
So that's what I had tried to do.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"So we took $114 million across the enterprise in direct COVID losses none of
that was in personal insurance.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"There was some component of management liability within Bond & Specialty Insurance
which Tom described in going through their combined ratio.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

"Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski
Executive VP & President of Business Insurance
Yes.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"The largest line for sure is workers' comp some property losses both domestically and internationally and then
dribs and drabs I would say in other lines but those are the 2 drivers with the comp by far being the largest.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer

offsetting of the favorable frequency on some of those lines also.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
Okay.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
And then my second question is maybe a follow-up on the prior question on workers' comp.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"We've heard a few
folks in the industry it seems like starting to point towards the bottom of comp in terms of just the pricing dynamics there.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

we've seen in that business are close to coming to an end.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

of the pricing dynamics there and whether we might hit an inflection and I'm not just talking 2020 perhaps into 2021 as
well?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer

frankly it's probably the uncertainties for the economy that have the biggest impact on -- of the pandemic on us.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

"And we've put up that net number with a high
degree of caution.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
So I can't give you a number.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

rate change so it was pretty strong you said double digits.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Wondering if we could get a finer point put on that.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And then
just sort of how that compares versus the last few quarters?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And also sort of thinking about -- and I think Dan you had
mentioned you're looking at loss trend of 5% now in the updated thinking.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

to the 7.4% renewal rate change that you got in the quarter?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

ballpark.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I think we've said previously the trend was around 4.5% in BI and we're taking it up about 0.5 point in the current

like for the year?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Daniel Stephen Frey
Executive VP & CFO
So I wouldn't say we normally do it in the fourth quarter I think what you're referring to maybe is we do it at the -- when
the policy period has ended [indiscernible].",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"There has been some -- and we've been open to it there have been some

"But in general what's your kind of take on what's going on with tort
right now?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Could we potentially see an increase in tort inflation as a result of what's going on with COVID-19?,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

"And so there's a slight offset as
we see the frequency.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

"Now as the economy is starting to reopen we're seeing
that frequency moderate.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Jamminder Singh Bhullar
JPMorgan Chase & Co Research Division

And on the personal auto side are you assuming or expecting additional refunds in the third quarter as well?,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Gregory Cheshire Toczydlowski
Executive VP & President of Business Insurance
So we don't have further refunds planned in personal auto.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I think like many we're looking forward at what rate adequacy
is over time and looking at more traditional mechanisms like rate filings to make sure that rate's in line with loss trend and
loss cost.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And in personal auto the refunds really were a mechanism to respond to an acute issue in the early days of the
pandemic is sort of the way we're thinking about it.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Jamminder Singh Bhullar
JPMorgan Chase & Co Research Division
Okay.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
And then just lastly you mentioned majority of the COVID losses were related to workers' comp.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"You didn't really
mention anything about business interruption.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And I'm assuming those losses were pretty modest but is that more
because you haven't seen a lot of claim submission?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Or is it just your view -- you have seen submission but your view is
that those planes are uninsured given the policy language?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
Yes.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
We've certainly seen some submissions and there's some claim activity around it and even some litigation around it.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"As we've noted we've got provisions in our policies that we think make that coverage inapplicable and so we don't expect
many of those claims actually to pay out.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Daniel Stephen Frey
Executive VP & CFO
It's Dan.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt

acknowledged in our reserves the fact that we'll spend some money defending against claims that come in for business
interruption.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Jamminder Singh Bhullar
JPMorgan Chase & Co Research Division
Okay.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"And on COVID is that the line where you see the most uncertainty in terms of claims given what happens on -- in
terms of litigation activity?",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
Or are there other lines where there's not a lot of clarity based on what's happened so far?,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"Alan David Schnitzer
Chairman & CEO
I don't think there's a lot of uncertainty around business interruption.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
"I mean certainly there's some because there's some
litigation and there's always uncertainty when you have litigation but we've got the requirement for direct fiscal damage.",2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
We've got 2 courts that have upheld that so far.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
And we've got a specific virus exclusion in our standard policy form.,2020-6-30 Travelers Transcript.txt
