Presentation
Operator
Good day everyone and welcome to the Chubb Limited Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.
Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And now for opening remarks and introductions I
would like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer Senior Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead
ma'am.
Karen L. Beyer
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Chubb's September 30 2019 Third Quarter Earnings
Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements including statements relating
to company performance and growth opportunities pricing and business mix and economic and market
conditions which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially.
Please see our recent SEC filings earnings release and financial supplement which are available on our
website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters.
We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures reconciliations of which to the most direct
comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial
supplement.
Now it's my pleasure to introduce our speakers this morning. First we have Evan Greenberg Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft our Chief Financial Officer we'll then take your
questions.
Also with us to assist you with your questions are several members of our management team. And now I'll
turn the call over to Evan.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Good morning. We had a strong third quarter with core operating earnings up double digit and excellent
premium revenue growth globally. Growth benefited from a continuously improving pricing and
underwriting environment where insurance rates and terms continued to firm quarter-over-quarter in
major areas of our business.
Our growth is also benefiting from our many product customer and distribution-related growth initiatives
around the globe particularly in the U.S. Asia and Latin America.
Core operating income was $2.70 per share up 12%. The balance of our earnings between underwriting
and investment income was very good with underwriting income of $754 million up 12.5% and adjusted
net investment income of $910 million up 3%.
Global P&C underwriting income which excludes agriculture was up 27.7%. The combined ratio was
90.2% and benefited from lower year-on-year cats offset partially by higher crop losses another cat-like
risk.
On a current accident year basis excluding cats the combined ratio was 89.5% and excluding ag it
was 88.3% up modestly like 0.4% from prior year. Book and tangible book value per share were up
2% and 3.3% respectively in the quarter and are up 9.8% and 15.7% since December 31 driven by a
combination of strong income and the mark from falling interest rates. While benefiting temporarily our
company's book value growth prolonged low interest rates a result of over-alliance on monetary policy
have penalized savers and led to misallocation of capital and overvaluation of assets without substantially
supporting business investment and economic growth.

CHUBB LIMITED FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 30 2019
Annualized core operating return on equity for the quarter was 9.5%. Phil will have more to say about
investment income book value cats and prior period development.
Turning to growth and the rate environment. P&C premium revenue in the quarter in constant dollars was
quite strong. Net premiums grew 7.2% and then foreign exchange had a 1 point negative impact.
As I noted at the beginning the pricing environment continued to improve quarter-on-quarter with the
rate of increase accelerating and spreading to more classes of business and risk type. For perspective rate
increases in both our North America commercial lines and on our London wholesale businesses this quarter
were double those of the first quarter 6.4% versus 3.2% and 17% versus 8% respectively.
In the U.S. rates continued to firm in major accounts E&S wholesale specialty and the middle market.
In our international operations we continue to observe firming conditions in the London wholesale
market and in Australia while rates began to increase in the U.K. retail market and parts of the continent
particularly for large risks. The market is responding to the fact that rates have not kept pace with loss
costs over a number of years which has put pressure on margins and ultimately on reserves.
Rates have gone down while loss costs have risen. Pretty simple math. However as we have been saying
for some time the frequency of severity and certain long-tail and short-tail classes has been worsening
while at the same time in other classes it has remained subdued or declined.
For the sake of simplicity let's divide long-tail loss into 3 buckets. Bucket 1 generally speaking in the
attritional loss layers severity has been increasing at a relatively modest pace and frequency has been
steady though there are exceptions.
In the second bucket in excess layers the frequency of large claims settlements has been increasing
and putting pressure on rate adequacy a consequence of so-called social inflation but also casualty
attachment points not moving for years. A $1 million attachment point for casualty excess 10 years ago is
worth a fraction of the amount today.
And finally the third bucket. There has been an increase in class actions large to mega everything from
securities and antitrust related to science-based. For example chemical pharma and physical trauma
related. And there are casualty cat-type events such as molestation-related reviver statues legislative
actions.
I have spoken about all of this for some time now. In my judgment given the simple math the risk
environment and a reset of risk appetite on the part of many the current market conditions are
sustainable.
Returning to the quarter. Overall prices increased in North America commercial on a written basis by 6.8%
versus a loss cost trend of about 4.5%. Renewal price change includes both rate of 6.4% and exposure
change of 0.4%.
As I noted last quarter we are also benefiting from a flight to quality particularly in large account and
specialty as more business meets our underwriting standards. Given the choice many potential customers
prefer Chubb.
New business in North America Commercial Lines was up 18.5% in the quarter with major accounts in
Specialty up over 23% and middle market and small commercial up over 9.5%.
Retention of our customers remained very strong across all of our North America Commercial and
Personal P&C businesses with renewal retention as measured by premium of 96.6%.
In major accounts and specialty commercial excluding agriculture premiums were up 9.5% with major
accounts retail up about 5.5% and E&S wholesale up over 18%. Rates for major accounts were up over
8% with risk management up 4.5% excess casualty up 17.5% and property up over 29%. Public D&O
rates increased over 17.5%.
In our E&S wholesale business rates were up about 7.5% with property up 17% and Financial Lines up
8.5%.

CHUBB LIMITED FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 30 2019
Turning to our middle-market and small commercial business. Premiums overall were up 5.6% and
renewal retention in our middle-market business was 92%.
Middle-market pricing was up over 6% and excluding workers comp up about 6.5%. Pricing for primary
casualty was up 7.7% property up 7.3% excess umbrella up 7% and public D&O rates up 32%.
In our North America Personal Lines business net premiums written in the quarter were up 2.7% but
adjusting for the expanded reinsurance that we have discussed in the past net premiums written were
up almost 4% our best quarter of the year. Retention remains strong at 97% on a premium basis and
steady at over 90% on a policy basis. Homeowners pricing was up 10.7% in the quarter.
Turning to our international business. Growth accelerated in our Overseas General Insurance operations
with net premiums written up about 11% in constant dollar and FX then had a negative impact of about
3.5 percentage points. Net premiums for our London market wholesale business were up 29% while our
retail division was up over 9.5% with growth broadly distributed across the globe.
Growth in our international retail business was led by Latin America and Asia Pacific up circa 10% and
9% respectively with U.K. retail in the continent up over 8% and 6% a very good result.
Overall rates in our London wholesale business were up 17%. Our Asia-focused international life
insurance business had a strong quarter with net written premiums up over 20% in constant dollar and a
contribution to earnings of $40 million up over 43% from prior year.
John Keogh John Lupica and Paul Krump can provide further color on the quarter including current market
conditions and pricing trends.
In closing this is a very good quarter for Chubb. Premium revenue growth continued to accelerate as
more business met our underwriting standards and we continue to achieve greater price adequacy in an
improving underwriting environment. At the same time we are executing on our many long-term growth
initiatives around the globe. Our organization is firing on all cylinders.
With that I'll turn the call over to Phil and then we'll come back to take your questions.
Philip V. Bancroft
EVP & CFO
Thank you Evan. We ended the quarter with a very strong overall financial position. Our businesses and
investment performance produced positive cash flow in the quarter of $2.2 billion. We grew our assets
to $175 billion including cash and invested assets of $109 billion which generated strong investment
income and we grew total capital to over $68 billion.
Among the capital-related actions in the quarter we returned $819 million to shareholders including $341
million in dividends and $478 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date through yesterday we have
repurchased over $1.3 billion in shares at an average price of $145.70 per share.
Our annualized core operating return on tangible equity was 15.6%. Adjusted net investment income for
the quarter of $910 million pretax was higher than our estimated range and benefited from higher private
equity distributions and increased corporate bond call activities.
Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $263 million after-tax. There was a gain of $503
million in the investment portfolio from a decline in interest rates partially offset by a loss of $112 million
from our variable annuity portfolio and a loss of $116 million from FX.
Although market yields have declined significantly in recent months we will remain conservative in our
investment strategy and do not contemplate any significant shift in asset allocation.
Despite the negative impact of lower interest rates we expect our growth in invested assets and strong
cash flow will support current investment income levels. We now expect our quarterly adjusted net
investment income run rate to be approximately $900 million.

CHUBB LIMITED FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 30 2019
Pretax catastrophe losses in the quarter were $232 million with about 90% from U.S. weather-related
events including Hurricane Dorian and the balance from international events primarily in Japan.
In addition agriculture underwriting income was adversely impacted by weather conditions resulting in
underwriting income of $1 million compared to $79 million in the prior year.
We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $167 million pretax or $112 million after-
tax. This included $27 million pretax adverse development related to legacy environmental exposures.
The remaining favorable development of $194 million comprises $279 million favorable development from
long-tail lines principally from accident years 2015 and prior and adverse development from $85 million
in short-tail lines principally from noncat large losses in commercial property lines.
On a constant dollar basis net loss reserves decreased $137 million reflecting the impact of favorable
prior period development and catastrophe loss. On a reported basis the paid-to-incurred ratio was 103%
for the quarter. After adjusting for the items I discussed the paid-to-incurred ratio was 96%.
Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.1% which is in line with our annual expected
range of 14% to 16%. Through 9 months our core operating effective tax rate was 15%.
As a clarification to a point in the press release relating to North America commercial we had a 2-point
increase in our loss ratio. 1 point is property related year-to-date losses were higher than our selected
loss ratio. The other point is long-tail related simply higher loss fix this year than last and in line with
previous quarters no change.
I'll turn the call back over to Karen.
Karen L. Beyer
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you. At this point we're happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Paul Newsome Sandler O'Neill.
Jon Paul Newsome
Sandler O'Neill + Partners L.P. Research Division
Congratulations on the quarter everyone. I was hoping you could touch a little bit more on your
comments on the tort environment which I found very interesting. And specifically I'm curious if the
buckets and descriptions you're using are just attributed to the U.S.? Or given you're international
focused also something we can think about having similar issues in or developments in the international
markets?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes. That's a good question. The -- when it comes to securities related -- and we don't see it in general
casualty. General casualty is behaving in a steady way. We don't see the same factors that we see now
the U.K. Germany which is always been the troubled environment and Australia. There you see the
same trends and in a place like Australia it's even more acute. But that's been for some time and I've
been talking about it for a while because it's the same -- we've observed the trends for the last couple of
years. The U.K. has worsened over the last 2 years maybe 3. Australia has been -- it began deteriorating
about 4 years ago and accelerated and is just a stupid environment now. And Germany given their
insured versus insured and the fact that they have -- you have 2 Boards in a company has been a difficult
environment for a long time. But that's about it. The other markets around the world kind of minor.
Jon Paul Newsome
Sandler O'Neill + Partners L.P. Research Division
Great. And then separately just a more topical comment on the California wildfires and exposures. Is
there anything about Chubb's exposures out there that would be different from the last couple of years
just from a pure -- from an exposure from a reinsurance perspective?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Well let's see the last couple of years we do have a quota share that we did not have before. That would
be the one major difference. Over the last year in particular though it began 2 years ago but really it's
been the last year we've been reshaping the portfolio. Given the underwriting environment and the level
of rate we can charge we've been -- we've aggressively pursued more rate increase so that earns into
the portfolio and has a benefit and we've reshaped the portfolio around the margin and that continues
particularly in extreme wildfire zones.
Operator
Our next question will come from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
My first question on Evan going back also to some of your comments on inflation. Now North America
commercial you guys -- you just pointed to consolidated trend about 4.5% which is in line with what you
guys have been saying in the past couple of quarters. So just given the whole environment and what you
see out there in terms of class action lawsuits et cetera picking up I mean do you view that as kind of
the right base on -- as we think about where a trend could be over the next 12 months?

CHUBB LIMITED FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 30 2019
Chairman & CEO
Elyse our trend reflects everything we know. And we have -- and it's the overall portfolio. So that's
everything. Long and short tail. We have classes in long and short tail where the loss cost trend is benign.
And we have in both long- and short-tail classes where it is less benign and I specifically spiked out to
talk about the casualty and I'm using casualty in the broad sense including professional lines. The areas
where we for some time have been talking about that loss cost trends or the strike loss cost trends the
loss environment has been worsening or becoming more hostile. That's all baked into that 4.5%. Our
selected trend factors by line reflect everything we know that we can mathematically calculate is -- and
substantiate is in our loss picks. Now we can't speak about the future because we don't know the future.
We only know what we can observe today and the trends as we see them today and we've reflected all of
that.
Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question in terms of North America commercial the prior
year developments slowed I believe it's all due to what Phil pointed out in terms of the noncat losses in
Commercial Property. I just wanted to clarify -- so did all -- away from just noncat property did all their
lines within commercial develop favorably in the quarter? If we can just get a little bit more color on that.
Were there releases within that business?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
In the current accident year you're speaking to current accident year?
Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
No. I was talking about the prior year development. So the $109 million this year versus the $216 million
last year within North America commercial.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
We had releases and we had -- we took reserve charges as we told you. And when you say lines it's the
lines that we study in the quarter. We don't study -- or we don't do a deep dive study on all lines every
quarter. And as we've described numerous times we have a schedule for that. And so of the lines studied
in the quarter those would be the long-tail ones that had releases. And by the way it's many sub-lines
and so some have some increases some have decreases but the aggregate that we gave you was a
decrease in reserve.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Greg Peters with Raymond James.
Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates Inc. Research Division
I have one question and a follow-up. Evan in your prepared remarks and I'm not trying to put words
in your mouth but I believe you suggested that assets might be overvalued due to the low interest rate
environment. And I'm curious how you want your investors to view those comments in the context of your
investment portfolio.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes. What I was really relating to more than anything in my mind is I look at the prices people are
paying to buy assets all kinds of assets. And in my mind in particular I think about is the -- we purchase
insurance companies and we look at those assets and I find the market knows to be tremendously
Copyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 9
CHUBB LIMITED FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 30 2019
overvalued. And when I look at the prices being paid and so much private equity and in high tech and
IT related and technology related the asset values are tremendously inflated. I'm really making the
comment that investors are chasing absolute yield not risk-adjusted yield. When I come to our own
investment portfolio we're very careful about how we invest for risk-adjusted return not absolute yield.
And that's why Phil made the comment that there won't be and you won't see a change in our investment
philosophy and strategy because we're disciplined and we're not just going to chase the highest yield
for example in high-yield bonds where we're active. We know what the -- we know what we think the
right risk-adjusted price is from looking at historic default trends et cetera. We're not going to chase. And
that's what my comments were related to.
Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates Inc. Research Division
Thanks for the clarification. I want to pivot -- and at the outset I just want you to realize I'm not trying to
get you to criticize your distribution partners. But if I consider the stock market performance as a measure
of success the insurance brokers have outperformed the underwriters on a 1 3 and 5-year basis. And
I was wondering if you could just update us on your views about the symbiotic relationship with your
insurance brokers and/or if it's changed?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes. That bounces around and we're in the risk-taking business. Brokerage is in the intermediation
business only and I realize we're both in the advisory business that way. I -- that they have done well
it's not a zero-sum game. If they have done well I applaud them for it. I reflect they've done a good job
and congratulations and we'll run our own race. And I'm not concerned with Chubb's ability to outperform
over reasonable periods of time and that's particularly in comparison to those who were like us risk
takers. Secondly has the relationship changed? No it's fundamentally the same relationship it has been
for years. It changes based on tools and capabilities change. But beyond that the relationship is -- the
foundation of it is -- hasn't changed. And that is a broker is in the business of representing their client
and their client's interest and helping them to select -- advising them and helping them to select the
right coverages the right insurers and put together the right program. They intermediate that and our
relationship is -- brokerage is an ambivalent relationship. You work in partnership together and you also
work -- you work for each of your respective interests.
Operator
Our next question will come from Mike Zaremski with Crédit Suisse.
Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG Research Division
First question Evan when you were talking about the competitive environment in your prepared remarks
I think you used the term reset of risk appetite on the part of some competitors. Do you feel that that
reset is causing maybe pricing to move well in excess of loss trend and low interest rate pressures in
certain lines? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is that I think we all know that there is a number of
competitors kind of resetting and that gives us confidence -- a new confidence that the rate environment
stays -- is moving in the right direction. But I guess a lot of investors ask us whether Chubb's margins can
maybe eventually benefit more so than peers if the environment persists?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Look I can only speak about what I know not what I don't know. There are lines of business -- there
are numerous lines of business where rate is exceeding loss cost trend and that is it's healing margins
and therefore it is naturally ameliorating and benefiting margin and then there are other lines. And some
of that it's actually improving the underwriting margin and in some areas it needs to go further because
it's not -- it's still not adequate to earn in a positive underwriting margin. So it's all over the line. As far
as Chubb's margin goes I'm not going to prognosticate about the future. The trends as we see them are
Copyright © 2019 S&P Global Market Intelligence a division of S&P Global Inc. All Rights reserved.
spglobal.com/marketintelligence 10
CHUBB LIMITED FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 30 2019
positive they are good and all things being equal it benefits margin. However I can't speak to the future
loss cost environment and future trends that way so that's why I never predict the future when it comes
to that. We're in the risk business.
Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG Research Division
Okay. That's helpful. And lastly kind of as a follow-up to one of the previous questions Evan you said
that broadly speaking asset values are inflated and I think you alluded to also the M&A environment
but you can correct me if I'm wrong. So does that imply that there's maybe less M&A opportunities today
than I guess -- well there hasn't been much M&A for you guys in recent years? And maybe Phil can also
remind us of the drag excess capital is having on your ROE?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes. In the environment sure you haven't -- you've seen us quiet and you observe the prices for assets
yourselves. I assume you come to the same conclusion I do. Phil on ROE?
Philip V. Bancroft
EVP & CFO
The drag on the ROE it's in the range of 0.7% to 1%.
Operator
Our next question will come from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.
Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Research Division
Evan this is probably just me not in full capacity after a busy night so I apologize in advance but there is
something I don't quite understand.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Did you drink too much?
Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Research Division
I drank a lot of insurance P&L.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
That's intoxicating.
Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Research Division
So overall loss trend remained stable at 4.5% which incorporates lines that are deteriorating others that
are benign. But if it remains stable why are we seeing Chubb and peers increasingly vocalizing concerns
over loss trend deterioration? And why are rates as a whole firming?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Because the loss environment in those troubled lines you do see trends and you do see it showing up
in overall loss picks that you've seen loss ratios in casualty rising -- and I'm using casualty broadly I'm
using the term to include professional lines and general casualty and taking out workers comp. It varies by
line but you've been hearing about it and seeing it in commercial auto. You've been hearing about it and

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11
CHUBB LIMITED FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 30 2019
you've seen it in D&O and medical malpractice and excess liability. And so that has focus and attention
from -- underwriters see it and the investing community sees it so there is dialogue about that. And I
do think that it is -- the loss cost environment there has not been benign. I've been talking about it for a
while. Our own loss picks in those areas have been increasing. It does have an impact on our overall loss
ratios because it gets blended in there and it has. And so you need to be aware of it and focus on it. And it
is a trend right now. It has been and is. Am I making sense to you?
Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Research Division
Yes. And is this the way it means though that even if the loss -- long-term loss remains stable there is a
certain reset of a base given the recent experience?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Not a reset of the base. But remember we're talking loss ratios and that's calendar year that can include
prior period reserves that includes current accident year. So naturally you've seen very strong rate and
with more benign loss years releasing reserves -- industry releasing reserves into earnings when I take
prior period. And you know as you get to more recent years rates had been going down loss cost trends
have been rising and you've seen underneath the surface of these loss cost trends some of these ones
that I just talked about and have been talking about that are more troubling and they show up. And then
in the current that all then rolls forward to the current accident year loss picks where you raise your
expectations based on what you see today and has -- it has trended from the recent and past years.
Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Research Division
Okay. And then my follow-up question is...
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Am I making sense? Am I being clear for you?
Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Research Division
I think so. I may follow-up off-line but I think I got the general gist. And then my second question is just
around -- you had mentioned the 3 buckets attritional loss layers excess in large to mega. Can you offer
maybe a broad distribution of premiums for Chubb by those buckets?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
No no. I don't have those...
Operator
We'll go next to Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
I guess I appreciate Evan your comments on not wanting to kind of go and predict the future. I guess I
would ask then on your North America commercial that you had 90 bps of deterioration in the core how
much of -- and you call out the commercial property. I mean can you say how much that 90 bps would
have been without that commercial property losses?
Evan G. Greenberg

That's correct. Yes.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
The loss ratio in North America commercial was 2 points. We told you 1 point was year-to-date property
where loss is outside the loss pick and we said the other 1 point was casualty related. That's casualty
long-tail lines which is casualty broadly. And that was just -- and that was in line with our loss picks all
year. No change. That's just rate and trend. And we -- Phil gave you that.
Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
Yes. No perfect. And then I guess on those 3 buckets again that was just asked do you have any
concerns on what you see in that second layer kind of filtering back down into the first layer that you
talked about the first bucket?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
No. We're not -- no we're not seeing it that way. And think about it a little bit. The average loss always it
increases by the -- a normal trend factor in the primary layer. Frequency has been pretty steady. So we --
jittery a little bit and -- but steady. And the severity has risen at a -- kind of a normal loss cost trend. But
what it does is when attachment points -- and that's what I was trying to say -- in excess don't change
over years and years and years then more losses bleed into that layer. Do you get it?
Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
Yes.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
And that's separate from the larger one-offs that large excess losses that I talked about. I broke bucket
2 down into 2 pieces for you. And so to answer your question no I don't see that. Actually it works the
opposite.
Operator
We'll go next to Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.
Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
Evan I wanted to go back to your comment in your prepared remarks where you said that conditions
are sustainable. I was just a little bit confused on what in particular is sustainable. Is it the pricing
environment? Is it where you view the loss trend environment? Just I guess maybe a little more
specificity on that please.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes buddy you're overthinking it. I was talking about the underwriting and pricing environment only.

Got it. So broadly speaking. And I guess I want to follow...
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Broadly speaking the trend we see in pricing and underwriting we see -- in the areas that this is
impacting we see it continuing.
Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
Understood. And then I guess my follow-up is keeping it on this discussion about -- it sounds like -- and I
might be wrong on this but it sounds like there might be a difference between the conversation about loss
trend and the conversation about loss picks. Is it like for instance Phil mentioned that -- sorry Evan.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Go ahead. No go ahead.
Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
So Phil's comment that because it's casualty lines in North America the accident year loss ratio
deteriorated a point. Yes it's similarly to previous quarters but in previous quarters you seemingly
didn't have quite as much rate. So is it such that there's an uncertain enough loss environment that
you're observing a certain level of trend but maybe you're saying we should out of an abundance of
conservatism just continue to set loss picks a little bit higher and that's why that's perhaps staying at 1
point? Or is it more simple than that and it's -- and I just have that wrong?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
It's more simple than that. I'm trying to understand what your -- how you're thinking about it. But
remember the loss ratio is based on earned rate not written rate. And it's earned rate over the loss pick
you had earned rate goes into -- again you trend losses forward. We have an overall loss trend factor of
4.5% we had an earned rate of whatever it was in those long-tail areas. That went into us imagining a
loss pick for the year in those casualty areas of x and that has remained steady. We have not changed the
loss ratios we have selected in part of -- in any of our casualty areas.
Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
So as more of that earned rate comes in we would expect that point of deterioration to moderate.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Then the earned premium grows then you look at the loss cost trend for each line and you decide does it
remain the same? Or does it go up or go down? Ok that's what I can give you Ryan. That's why I'm not
prognosticating future. I go back to that. But I'll -- based on what I see right now I've got a 4.5% loss
cost trend and I've got -- and that is a blend of all lines of business and we've got rate that exceeds loss
cost trends in North America on a written basis.

Evan I'm just curious are you getting tightening terms and conditions and enough to maybe ameliorate
some of this loss cost trend if you're going forward? Or should we not think about it that way?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Are we getting changes in terms and conditions?
Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
Yes. Tightening enough that maybe can -- the 4.5% that you're seeing or some of the social inflation.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
In some -- and I don't want overstate it. So I don't -- you can't bake it in in the overall. But we are
getting more changes in deductibles we're getting changes in sub-limits we're getting changes in
attachment points in casualty excess and those things are all part and are ameliorating and we put
values on those.
Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
And that's not in your -- when you give us your price increases that's not included in that is it?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
In some lines it is because where we can actually measure it it is an exposure adjustment and then we
take rate against exposure and we determine -- what we can determine mathematically that allows us --
that is the same thing as rate. So we do -- we consider it.
Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
Great. And then my follow-up question Evan I'm just curious PG&E I know it has been talked about a
little bit. There's nice subrogation that should be coming through there. What are your kind of thoughts on
that subrogation when can you potentially see some of that come through?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
I'm not going to speculate on that. But we don't see any material or substantial future subrogation
opportunity for Chubb from PG&E.

CHUBB LIMITED FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 30 2019
No no no. I don't think anyone got to it. But yes I guess there was a little bit of a higher loss pick there.
I mean I guess first of all what does that incorporate? How much development could we potentially
expect on that in the fourth quarter? And what are you still thinking a good combine ratio use for that
business is when you look out to 2020 or just I guess normalized annual combined ratio for the overall
crop segment?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
I'll just take that last part. We've run in the in the high 80s to 90% historically and we don't see a change
to that. And by the way look at the last number of years we had excellent results the last few years in
that business. It has a natural volatility it's crops it has both an attritional and a cat-like nature to it. And
this year we're going to have a less-than-average year for that business and let me turn it over to John
Lupica for a minute to give you a little more color on that.
John Joseph Lupica
Vice Chairman and President of North America Major Accounts & Specialty Insurance
Yes. Thanks Evan and Ryan too. We certainly adjusted the year-to-date numbers in the quarter based
on what we know today. And we still have to capture all of the yields from the field before we can really
put a final number. The nice part about the year is prices are pretty much at base prices we finish out the
October harvest price schedule. So due to the delay in planting the harvest period has been pushed out 5
to 6 weeks. So I think by the end of the year we'll obviously have a better sense of the year. And as Evan
noted if we don't see any change off our expectation we certainly expect it to be in that low 90s area.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Low 90s combined for the fourth quarter would be about where we would imagine if nothing changes from
what we know now. But God there's a lot of unknowns out there. We have no idea right now about yields.
We just don't know.
Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
Perfect. And I guess I want to ask one more. Workers comp Evan obviously been at some rate pressure.
I mean how are you seeing absolute levels of profitability there? Are there fewer opportunities today than
there were one -- at one point? Yes I mean what's the outlook right now on workers comp?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
For Chubb that's not a growth area at this time. We -- it has -- loss cost trends have been quite benign
and the industry has responded with a lot of competition and lowering the prices some of it rational
some of it to us just beginning to overshoot that mark. And loss -- the benign loss cost environment it's
questionable whether that will remain. And so we have been -- as rates have been coming down we have
been exerting more discipline in that area. It has not been a growth area for us. And I'm speaking about
first dollar primary risk transfer business. In our risk management business that's a whole different book.
And that's where the -- that's large account where it's self-insured or self-funded on some basis and we
provide all kinds of services and we provide excess coverage. And there we're -- that's an area that we're
quite active and probably the largest writer of that in the United States and we have a lot of knowledge
and capability and that's where the client has skin in the game and so that seems to be different.

I know it's early days with regard to other catastrophe loss potential in 4Q but any initial perspective
on Typhoon Hagibis and the California wildfires? And looking at that relative to what was a pretty heavy
catastrophe loss a year ago in the fourth quarter around 8 points of catastrophe losses on the combined
ratio how should we think about that?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Well you should think that this is the end of October. So we're 1/3 through the movie. And I can't tell
you how the movie ends. I didn't see it before. So I don't know. We're in the risk business and we're in
-- and part of being in the risk business we take catastrophe exposure. And so I don't wring my hands
about having catastrophe losses I'm just concerned did we measure the exposure correctly? And did
we charge a proper price for taking the risk? Other than that I'm going to have that volatility. So I'm not
wringing my hands. On the Japan typhoon so far from everything we know it is not a significant event
for Chubb. On the California wildfires they are ongoing right now. The only thing we know is the Tick fire
is the one that's out. And on that one we didn't have any -- we didn't have any losses. And on the other
2 I -- it's just very early days and I'd rather not predict. And I don't know what the outcomes will be. At
this moment our losses are very minor.
Jay H. Gelb
Barclays Bank PLC Research Division
Right. Understood. And then on a separate issue I just want to follow up on the North America
commercial. The gross written premium in the third quarter was up 10% year-over-year. Was there
anything -- any one-timers in there that would have influenced that? Or was that kind of a true
perspective on the growth rate that you're now seeing in that business giving improving market
conditions?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
We didn't have anything mega in the quarter but we write large account there. And so we won a number
of new large accounts and that's what just gets baked into that. But nothing in particular that stands out
to us.
Jay H. Gelb
Barclays Bank PLC Research Division
So a strong acceleration in the core business production?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
It was a strong growth quarter. We won a number of new large accounts in the quarter. I -- but remember
it's lumpy business so I can't tell you the next quarter is going to be the same. It bounces around a bit.
But it was very good. We liked everything we saw about how the market behaved and moved towards us
in terms of rate and terms.

Our next question will come from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI.
David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities Research Division
Just had a question and appreciate the color on the 3 buckets. Just wanted to get a little bit more detail on
when you really saw or have seen an acceleration in the loss trends in the last 2 buckets? And specifically
if you've seen any increase over the last couple of quarters that you'd note?

CHUBB LIMITED FQ3 2019 EARNINGS CALL  OCT 30 2019
Nothing over the last couple of quarters that we'd note. I've been talking about this. If you go back into
shareholder letters into quarterly commentaries we've been talking about this for 2 years.
David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities Research Division
Got it. So no meaningful acceleration beyond what you've been mentioning. Okay. That's helpful. And then
just on the PPD in North America commercial. The Child Victims Act obviously went into effect this quarter.
Just wondering any early indications you got on your exposure there. And if that was an element that led
to the lower year-over-year PPD?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
No. 0 number one. Number two I think you're referring to New York. California went into effect I believe
the governor signed it last week. And there are a number of other states that are in the middle of passing
reviver statutes now. We have no way at this point of estimating the exposure and ultimate loss to Chubb
in that. And so -- you're at the very beginning it's way too early.
Operator
And ladies and gentlemen at this time we'll take our final question from Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. Research Division
Evan I was wondering if there is any way of quantifying broadly how much of the current insurance
market is adequately priced compared to a year ago.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Well Meyer we haven't done -- we haven't added it up that way or thought about it that way. And when
you say the market I -- that's asking -- I can't -- I cannot tell you the adequacy of the ocean overall. So
no.
Meyer Shields
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. Research Division
Okay. Fair enough. Second question given -- I don't know whether it's external weather issues or the
underlying climatological changes. Is there any way of assessing what loss trend is for North America
property lines?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
There is no way for you to assess that but we can assess that.
Meyer Shields
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. Research Division
Can you tell us what you've come up with?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
And it'll vary -- Meyer I'm not disclosing it but it will vary -- we're not going into sub-lines but it'll vary
-- we have a number of property portfolios. We have first dollar property that is admitted risk. We have
first dollar property that is E&S and they behave differently. We have excess property and we have other
coverages that go along with that. And then we have large account property and so -- and they all -- it all
behaves a little bit differently.
