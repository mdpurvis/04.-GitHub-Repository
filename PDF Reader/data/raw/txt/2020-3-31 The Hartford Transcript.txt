Chairman & CEO
Good morning and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. While The Hartford started 2020 with significant momentum
since our last call on February 4 all aspects of society and the global economy have been fundamentally changed by
COVID-19. In light of that I plan to spend the bulk of my time today focused on the pandemic including how we are
responding and how we are preparing for what comes next.
I want to begin by recognizing the human toll the pandemic is taking. On behalf of The Hartford and our more than 19000
employees my heart goes out to those who are affected by the virus. I pray for a full recovery for those who are sick
and extend my deepest gratitude to the health care professionals caring for them along with all the other workers on the
frontline of this crisis. I also want to acknowledge the millions of people who are struggling in other ways including those
who have lost jobs and livelihoods those who are trying to balance working from home with child care and homeschooling
and those already vulnerable or suffering from the isolation brought about by physical distancing.
People and businesses are facing circumstances they've never encountered before. Now more than ever they seek
strong leadership at all levels across all sectors of our society to navigate through this crisis in a way that protects public
health and safety and steer us towards economic and social recovery. At the Hartford we are committed to doing our part.
The company took quick and appropriate action in response to the pandemic. Our first priority was to ensure the health
and safety of our employees and their families. Thanks to the investments we've made in our capabilities over the past
several years and the extraordinary recent work of our technology team we were able in mid-March to immediately and
seamlessly transition more than 95% of our employees to a virtual environment. Since then our team has continued to
provide uninterrupted support and outstanding service that our customers expect. I'm incredibly proud of the resiliency

demonstrated by our employees and their commitment to our stakeholders during this crisis which speaks to The
Hartford's character.
We have also taken a number of steps to help our policyholders navigate through this crisis including providing payment
flexibility refunding personal auto customers and making premium adjustments for changes in exposure all of which
Doug will comment upon further. We have also significantly increased our communication efforts with agents brokers and
customers in the hopes of reducing some of the uncertainty they face during this unique time.
To support our communities The Hartford has donated in excess of $1 million to several organizations on the frontline
of this crisis including the CDC and the Center for Disaster Philanthropy. And we have enhanced and accelerated our
annual campaign supporting regional food banks like Foodshare.
As we have reacted to the immediate impacts of the pandemic on our customers and operations in the world around us
we've maintained a strong focus on preparing for the next normal. We've entered 2020 in a position of strength focused
on execution. And in the first quarter we continued to generate an industry-leading 12-month core earnings ROE of
13.3%. First quarter results in our Property & Casualty business benefited from pricing momentum lower catastrophe
losses favorable non-catastrophe weather and lower auto claim frequency. As The Navigators integration progresses
underwriting actions to improve profitability coupled with rigorous execution on renewal pricing and rate increases are
driving an improvement in underwriting margins compared to the second half of 2019.
The business impact from COVID-19 was approximately $50 million pretax in the first quarter including $16 million
of increased claims in short-term disability and from expanded benefits under New York's revised Disability and Paid
Family Leave legislation; a $10 million reduction in estimated audit premiums receivable; and a $24 million increase in the
allowance for current expected credit losses on premiums receivable reinsurance recoverables and other balances. Doug
will provide additional details on our Property & Casualty results.
Before I return to the topic of COVID-19 and how we are thinking about the next normal I'll spend a few moments
addressing our first quarter Group Benefits performance. For the quarter Group Benefits posted core earnings of $115
million with a margin of 7.8%. These results were above expectations and reflect the strength of our book of business.
Persistency on the combined employers' block of business was approximately 88%. It was a solid sales quarter across
market segments and product lines with fully insured ongoing sales of $385 million. The overall loss ratio improved by 2.8
points driven by favorable life and voluntary results which were partially offset by increased disability loss ratio.
Excluding the effects of COVID-19 previously discussed disability underlying trends remained favorable with strong
recoveries in recent accident years. Incidence trends were consistent with recent experience albeit slowing year-over-
year improvement. As we look forward we anticipate increased claims activity from COVID-19 primarily in short-term
disability and life insurance as well as statutory paid family leave benefits in certain states. The virus has proven so far
to be less acute for individuals under the age of 65 which is the vast majority of our business. However it is clear that
people of all age groups and demographic profiles are at some level of risk. We expect higher claim volumes in all these
lines throughout the second quarter. Beyond that the variables driving elevated losses are highly dependent on how well
the virus is contained and ultimately treated. More broadly the economic impacts of efforts to contain COVID-19 is also a
factor to be considered as we look forward.
We are facing a recessionary environment that was triggered by a very unique circumstance and historical correlations
may not prove to be predictive. Nonetheless disability incidence levels may increase over the next 12 months. We had
been anticipating some increase previously. However COVID-19 may accelerate and deepen that trend. We are adapting
rapidly to all these changes operationally and in pricing and underwriting. Our most important priority is to meet the needs
of our customers and their employees during the crisis.
The Group Benefits business is a market leader and enters this period of uncertainty with a strong operational and
financial foundation. I am confident we will emerge from this pandemic in a continued strong position.
Now I'd like to make some general comments about the challenges we face as a country the role of the insurance
industry and how I think about The Hartford's future.
The economic challenges we face are truly unprecedented: the shelter-at-home mandates shut down entire sectors of the
economy leading to a projected 25% decline in GDP in the second quarter; a 25% drop in our estimated new business
start-ups in the last 6 weeks; unemployment rates above 10%; and historically low interest rates. We applaud the Federal
Reserve the Trump administration and Congress for taking quick and necessary steps to assist the capital markets and

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  APR 30 2020
support local businesses and individuals. These early steps have provided critical assistance to our economy and the
American people. Only the federal government has the tools and resources to address the extraordinary threat posed
by this fast-moving global pandemic and the economic fallout from the necessary orders closing businesses across the
country.
That said it will take significant partnership and coordination between federal state and local governments along with
help from the private sector not-for-profits and the American people to defeat this virus and safely reopen the economy.
As always the insurance industry will play a critical role in helping the country return to growth and prosperity. As an
industry we are actively paying claims resulting from COVID-19. The property and casualty sector entered the year in a
strong position but the sharp downturn we are experiencing will pressure growth and profitability. While the industry is
prepared to meet its current obligations it cannot accept retroactive changes to its policy obligations. There's been a lot
of debate and discussion in the media and various legislatures across the country about business interruption. The vast
majority of The Hartford's property policies that include business interruption and civil authority coverage require losses
to be caused by direct physical damage or loss to property. Any effort to retroactively rewrite these contracts presume
coverage or remove exclusions would threaten the very foundation of the insurance industry the sanctity of contracts
under our constitution and the principles of a free market economy. Doing so would threaten the ability of carriers to pay
losses rising out of everyday-covered perils our customers will inevitably face in the months and years ahead.
We understand that policymakers and regulators are under extraordinary pressure to provide even more assistance to
businesses they represent. But unlawfully and unconstitutionally shifting those losses from one industry to another is not
the answer. The industry has an obligation to vigorously defend the terms and conditions of its insurance contracts and
preserve the principle that premiums are paid for specific risks covered by the insurance policy.
Turning to The Hartford. Some of our businesses will be impacted more significantly than others. The size and duration
of the impact will depend on the pandemic's ultimate effect on the economy. We expect elevated claims activity in such
lines as workers' compensation short-term disability surety and D&O. We also expect to see some exposures decline.
And while it's still very early we anticipate corresponding declines in claims. We also expect additional pressure on net
investment income. In short we believe this to be an earnings event not a capital event.
While these days are certainly the most turbulent of our generation I remain confident about The Hartford's ability to
manage the uncertainty of this crisis over the coming quarters. We have a strong and well-capitalized balance sheet with
ample liquidity. When we defeat this pandemic there will be inevitably significant shifts in consumer spending habits
forcing businesses to change how they operate. We will be ready with products to meet the changing needs of our
customers. Small business is the backbone of the U.S. economy and will play an integral part in the eventual recovery.
The Hartford as the leading insurer of small business will continue to protect our customers against the covered losses
they face every day allowing them to return with confidence to financial self-sufficiency and growth.
We will continue to work with the federal government to create innovative tools the administration can use to provide
assistance to those who need help. We will work alongside our peers policymakers elected officials and public health
experts to develop a national solution for managing pandemic risk going forward in support of a resilient and well-
functioning economy.
My optimism for the future of society the economy and our company is grounded in The Hartford's history. For more than
2 centuries we have navigated through a host of global crises including multiple recessions 2 World Wars and the 1918
influenza pandemic. Based on the resiliency that is core to who we are I believe we will emerge from this crisis even
stronger.
As we have always done we will continue to leverage our expertise capabilities experience to deliver on the promises
set forth in our policies. This means prudently managing our business to ensure we are able to meet our financial
obligations many years into the future. Most of all it means approaching every customer interaction with transparency
speed and empathy.
Our company's purpose is clear. We underwrite human achievement. We know who we are and what we stand for.
Circumstances have changed and we must remain agile in response. We are unwavering in our commitment to our
customers our partners our communities and our people. With the combination of our heritage talented and dedicated
employees and our strategy for future success I'm confident that we have what we need to thrive.
Now I'll turn the call over to Doug.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  APR 30 2020
Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Thank you Chris and good morning everyone. I echo your sentiment for those individuals and families impacted by
COVID-19 as well as our deep appreciation for frontline workers who are protecting and supporting all of us. Against
that backdrop let me share commentary on the first quarter as well as perspective on our business in the face of this
pandemic.
Property & Casualty had a solid first quarter. Core earnings were slightly better than both last year and our expectations.
I'm pleased with the continued pricing momentum that is critical to improving the financial performance of both Middle
Market and Global Specialty. Let me get right into our business results.
Commercial Line's first quarter combined ratio was 99.1% increasing 3 points versus 2019. The underlying combined
ratio was 94.9 increasing 2.2 points. The deterioration was primarily due to expected compression in workers'
compensation margins in Small Commercial higher expenses and the inclusion of Navigators partially offset by favorable
non-CAT property results.
For the quarter renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 3.8% up 30 basis points from fourth quarter.
Excluding workers' compensation pricing was 7.4% up nearly 1 point over fourth quarter including incremental monthly
progress over the past 3 months. In Middle Market renewal written pricing in the U.S. excluding workers' compensation
increased 9.4% up 180 basis points from fourth quarter and 570 basis points from first quarter of 2019. Both property and
general liability pricing improved over 2 points since the fourth quarter and are now each in the high single digits. In Middle
Market excluding workers' compensation we've now achieved incremental pricing gains for 5 consecutive quarters.
On our last call I provided quite a bit of texture to the pricing story in Global Specialty. Let me provide a few updates. We
continue to experience strong pricing gains in both our U.S. wholesale book as well as the international portfolio which
is primarily written in Lloyd's. The U.S. wholesale book achieved 21 points of rate in the first quarter over 2 points better
than the fourth quarter. Several lines continued to achieve in excess of 20% including property auto and excess casualty.
The international portfolio also had equally strong pricing gains with continued emphasis on professional lines and energy.
Additionally considerable portfolio reshaping continues including shifting industry and geographic mix raising attachment
points and reducing policy limits. Combining these actions with our sustained pricing work I'm pleased with the improving
profit trajectory.
Let me pivot to Property & Casualty's loss results. Catastrophes were relatively modest. And outside of the unfavorable
development on U.S. ocean marine and Lloyd's syndicate reserves that were covered by ADC prior year development
on all other lines was insignificant in the quarter. COVID-19 loss trends were immature at March 31 and therefore had a
limited impact on our results.
Let me share a few more details on our commercial businesses beginning with Small Commercial which had another
very strong quarter posting an underlying combined ratio of 89.3. The current accident year loss ratio improved 0.8 point
as favorable non-CAT property results more than offset the margin compression in workers' compensation. As discussed
in the past this expected compression was driven by negative workers' compensation pricing.
In addition as you'll see across Property & Casualty segments expense ratio deterioration was driven by lower 2019
state tax assessments and a higher bad debt allowance recorded this quarter. The bad debt allowance increase was
$12 million in Small Commercial and $18 million across Property & Casualty reflecting the expected impacts of higher
customer defaults.
Small Commercial written premium was flat to last year. Our new business sales for the quarter were $157 million down
10%. This decrease was driven by the new business written in 2019 from the Foremost renewal rights transaction.
Middle & Large Commercial reported an underlying combined ratio of 100.4 in the first quarter an increase of 2.3 points.
In addition to the expense items mentioned earlier approximately 1 point of the increase related to a higher current
accident year loss pick for general liability. Written premium increased 5% driven by strong growth in loss-sensitive
construction and the addition of The Navigatorsâ retail excess casualty business. Retention and new business
production in Standard Commercial Middle Market business both declined due to rate and underwriting actions we're
taking across the book.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  APR 30 2020
In Global Specialty the underlying combined ratio was 96.4 improving 2.1 points from the second half of 2019. As
I mentioned earlier pricing and book re-underwriting actions are drivers of the improved results. In addition Global
Specialty delivered $217 million of direct new written premium in the quarter. We remain very encouraged about the
breadth of our new product offerings and the long-range core earnings forecast for Global Specialty.
Shifting over to Personal Lines. We're pleased with the performance producing an underlying combined ratio of 86.6
improving 2.5 points from a year ago. In Personal Lines auto the underlying combined ratio of 90.9 was 2.7 points better
than 2019. Favorable frequency trends driven by the relatively mild winter and shelter-in-place guidelines contributed to
the improved results. Severity was largely in line with expectations.
Now let me step back from our business results and reflect on the new challenges that COVID-19 will bring over the
coming quarter and into the rest of the year. Operationally we executed flawlessly. In a matter of days from decision to
execution almost our entire team moved to fully remote status without missing a beat. The resiliency of our employees
and their dedication to brokers and customers during the past 7 weeks has been inspiring.
As we look ahead to the next few months I would offer a few key points as it relates to the global pandemic. First we
communicated adjustments to normal business practices including providing additional time to pay premium and offering
flexible payment options extending billing grace periods through May 31 and the waiver of any late fees that would
otherwise apply; relaxing policy renewal requirements and deadlines as well as premium audit obligations; and adjusting
policy conditions to be responsive to extended vacancies caused by shelter-in-place guidelines. In addition since mid-
March we've endorsed more than 80000 policies and returned over $15 million of premium to customers. We've also
announced a 15% refund of April and May's personal auto premium due through a reduction in miles driven and lower
reported claims.
Second we expect that COVID-19 will have an impact on our premium flows. Let me start with Small Commercial.
We expect our normally strong retentions to be impacted by both reductions in exposure as well as business
closures. Reductions in exposure will likely be driven by lower customer payroll and sales primarily impacting workers'
compensation but also our business owners policy Spectrum to a lesser degree.
Our new business activity clearly slowed in the latter half of March and into April consistent with U.S. Census Bureau
statistics that point toward an approximate 25% decline in national new business applications. We expect a similar drop
in new business premium for the full second quarter. Written premium could be down approximately 15% in the second
quarter.
Relative to Middle Large and Specialty we expect retention and pricing trends during the second quarter to remain
generally consistent with prior quarters. Risk managers are juggling many priorities and I expect customers will change
carriers less often in this environment. This obviously means that new business levels will be off. Exposure reductions by
way of endorsement will continue but not to the extent of small business.
Finally there's been much written about losses related to the virus much of it misinformed. We continue to pay claims
according to our contract terms and conditions. As Chris said we will vigorously defend against any and all attempts to
unfairly disregard or broaden the terms and conditions of our policies. These contracts have formed the foundation for our
industry over decades. We will contest retroactive changes at every corner.
As I close let me again express my confidence in my teammates here at The Hartford. We've built a strong foundation
for our future. Our insurance and risk management platform is poised for greater success as both organic and new
capabilities blend together. We will be thoughtful with our decisions dealing with this pandemic and we will continue to be
the company our customers agents and shareholders can count on.
Let me now turn the call over to Beth.
Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO
Thank you Doug. I will review results for the investment portfolio Hartford Funds and corporate and cover a few other
items before turning the call over to Q&A.
Before I begin with a discussion of our investment results I'd like to point out that we have included new supplemental
information on our investment portfolio this quarter in the appendix of our earnings slide presentation.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 8
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  APR 30 2020
Our investment portfolio is broadly diversified and high-quality with an overall average credit rating of A+. As the business
cycle aged over the last couple of years we were active in reducing the risk profile of the portfolio and as a result have
relatively small allocations to below investment-grade securities equities and limited partnerships. The fixed maturity
portfolio is 96% investment-grade with nearly 3/4 of that rated A or better. The corporate exposure to higher-risk
industries including energy leisure and entertainment and airlines is very manageable and largely investment-grade with
a significant percentage in private placements that offer covenants to better protect our investment.
We deliberately seek to diversify our corporate and municipal risks through our allocations to structured products and
commercial mortgage loans. Our structured product holdings are very high-quality with an average rating of AA+ and 95%
rated A or higher. Our commercial mortgage loan portfolio is diversified with a loan-to-value ratio of 52% and debt service
coverage of about 2.5x coming into this crisis with no exposure to hospitality or retail malls. In addition since the end of
March we reduced our equity exposure taking advantage of the bounce in equities to further reduce risk investing the
proceeds primarily in high-quality fixed income investments.
Net investment income was $459 million for the quarter down $44 million from the fourth quarter of 2019 driven in part
by lower income from make-whole payments and mortgage loan prepayments and valuation declines on equity fund
investments in first quarter 2020.
For the quarter the current yield before tax excluding limited partnerships was 3.3%. For the second quarter we would
expect the yield to be flat with the first quarter. We have taken actions to increase liquidity to offset the expected decrease
in premium receipts due to COVID-19 including the effect of the billing relief that we have provided to our policyholders.
For the second quarter yield outlook of 3.3% the impact of this increase in liquidity is roughly offset by the assumed
absence of the valuation declines in equity fund investments experienced in the first quarter.
The annualized limited partnership return was 13.2% in the first quarter primarily due to strong private equity valuations
and distributions. As a reminder LP returns are reported on a quarter lag so we would expect to see second quarter
results negatively impacted by the market decline in the first quarter.
The net unrealized gain position of $600 million after tax on fixed maturities decreased by $1.1 billion from year-end driven
predominantly by significantly wider credit spreads partially offset by lower interest rates. Unrealized and realized losses
on equity securities net of gains on equity derivatives which are recorded within net realized capital losses in the income
statement were $311 million before tax in the quarter reflecting the impact of the equity market decline.
During the quarter we recorded impairments of $17 million pretax in our fixed maturity portfolio consisting of $12 million
of credit impairments and $5 million of intent-to-sell impairments.
Turning to Hartford Funds. Core earnings of $44 million were up 57% from first quarter of 2019 and up $4 million from the
fourth quarter of 2019. Core earnings in the quarter included a benefit of $12 million pretax driven by a reduction in the
contingent consideration payable related to the 2016 Lattice acquisition.
Assets under management for our exchange-traded products on which the contingent payment is based are down
significantly due to market declines. Excluding this adjustment first quarter core earnings would have been $35 million
compared to $28 million in the 2019 first quarter reflecting higher average AUM of 7% despite the decline in AUM at the
end of the first quarter which was down 20% from December 31.
Gross sales were up significantly in the first quarter from prior periods. However net flows were a negative $1.4 billion in
the first quarter driven by redemptions compared to net positive flows in first quarter 2019 of $874 million.
The corporate core loss was $64 million in the quarter compared to a core loss of $15 million in the first quarter of 2019.
The retained equity interest in Talcott which is reported on a 1-quarter lag generated a $3 million loss after tax in first
quarter 2020 compared with income of $22 million after tax in first quarter 2019. In addition net investment income in
corporate was down $15 million before tax from the prior year period due to a decline in invested assets at the holding
company primarily due to the acquisition of Navigators in the second quarter of 2019 and the impact of lower short-term
investment yields.
Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI was $44.07 up 1% from year-end 2019. Core earnings ROE over the last
12 months was 13.3%. We ended the quarter with approximately $800 million in holding company resources. In March
we repaid $500 million of maturing debt with a coupon of 5.5%. In the first quarter we repurchased 2.67 million shares for
$150 million.

THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  APR 30 2020
We have assessed our capital and liquidity positions under a number of stress scenarios and are very confident in our
ability to manage through this period. Nonetheless in light of the uncertainty in the current environment we have paused
our share repurchase activity and we'll evaluate the appropriate time to resume repurchases as the impact of COVID-19
become more known including loss cost trends potential reduction in written premium and the impact of extending
payment terms to our policyholders.
Since March we have focused as a company on managing the dynamic conditions of this pandemic. We have taken
action to increase liquidity on our balance sheet further reduce risk in our investment portfolio and proactively support our
customers in this difficult time. We will continue to monitor the external environment including economic developments
and take appropriate actions as we navigate through this changing landscape.
I'll now turn the call over to Susan so we can begin the Q&A session.

Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS.
Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
A couple of questions here. First Chris and Doug could you perhaps comment on the business interruption coverages?
And specifically how much of your business in the property and kind of bought business has a virus endorsement on it so
where your exposure there is? And then additionally could you comment on what percentage of your policies actually has
a specific virus exclusion with respect to the business interruption coverage?
Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Brian thank you. I hope you're well. So I would say a couple of things. One I'm extremely confident in our underwriting
and contractual terms. And we've really done an exhaustive review over the last 6 7 weeks of all our policies including
Navigators. And I would just tell you straight up that the vast vast majority of our contracts do have a virus exclusion and
that there could be a handful of occasions where in essence we've offered business interruption coverage without tied to
physical damage or property loss. But again a handful and those policies actually came from our Navigators acquisition.
So I think we got our arms around our policies our exposures. Our teams have really scrubbed everything over and over.
But Doug that's what I would share with Brian.
Douglas Graham Elliot
President
I think that's a good summary Chris.
Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
Did you book those ones with the endorsement in the quarterâ¦
Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
What I would say when we closed out the quarter obviously we booked what we knew. And that's why we took the
actions that you saw where we did from a receivable side a credit side from the Group Benefits side. And that's what
we booked. We booked what we saw what we were aware of. And I would say specifically no there was no specific
provision for a handful of those policies that I referred to that do have BI. But relatively I'll call it modest in totality.
Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
Got you. And then second question could you comment on the impact of the expanded kind of coverage presumption
we're seeing in workers' comp in various states? Lots of numbers being thrown out there by some of the kind of industry
NCCI et cetera et cetera. What are your thoughts on that? What's the potential impact on The Hartford et cetera?
Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Well it's -- as you said it's been active. And again as I said in my prepared comments I understand that people
are trying to take care of people in their states employees and things like that. But if you really study the history of the
workers' comp environment over the last 50 years it's a well-functioning well-understood business activity that I think
fairly compensates people that have been injured or obviously get sick at work. And we've had some prior experience with
this particularly with Ebola.

So I think the rules of the road are generally understood. And to expand presumptions to relax documentation to sort of
change the equation I think as you see it can be very disruptive to the industry. That said yes I do have some personal
sensitivities and for frontline health care workers and those that are treating the sick out of this virus and maybe there's
combinations or things that we could do there. But broad-based presumptions for many classes of business Brian just
doesn't make sense to me.
Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Brian the only thing I would add is that several states are talking about this presumption dynamic of workers' comp. I'm
not sure there are any 2 states that are the same. So it's a variety across states. And secondly we're working with our
trades to come together as a group to try to figure out responsible answers as we step forward in this crisis.
Operator
And the next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. Research Division
A couple of questions one big one. Doug in your prepared remarks you mentioned that there is some I guess
misinformed commentary. I was hoping you could -- would talk about what commentary you're seeing out there that
doesn't match your perception.
Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Yes. I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment Meyer about specifics. We treat each and every claim on its own
merits. We're looking at all the claims as they come in. We've been responsive. We're working through all the variety of
lines and coverages et cetera. So I think our claim group has done an outstanding job. It just frustrates me at times when
I feel like sometimes the press looks at us and doesn't give us the credit that I believe we deserve for what we do and how
we support the marketplace.
Meyer Shields
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. Research Division
Okay. Understood. The second question can you give us some insight in terms of changes to commercial auto claim
frequency that you've seen over the last 6 weeks or so?
Douglas Graham Elliot
President
We have our -- I'll say this our claim counts have been down both across personal and commercial. When it was clear by
the end of March that they were down for that 2-week period and expect it to continue into the second quarter Beth and I
and Stephanie Bush our entire group sat and worked through and ended up with the 15% refund for April and May. That
approximates $50 million plus or minus in money going back to customers.
And in Commercial we've also seen -- to a lesser degree but we've also seen fewer claim notices. We will watch that
carefully. We're discussing and debating our Commercial book as we speak. And as we come to any conclusions we will
certainly share it with you and all other parties.
Operator
And the next question comes from David Motemaden with Evercore.
David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities Research Division
Just a question for Chris and Doug. I guess just wanted to dig in a little bit just thinking about the potential reserves that
you may need to take heading into next quarter. Is there any way you can help size the limit at risk in Navigators for the
policies that don't require the property damage from the virus?

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 12
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  APR 30 2020
And then in your 10-Q it sounds like you do expect to get reinsurance coverage on the occurrence treaties but it sounds
like you expect limited recoveries given your current estimates of losses. Should I take that to mean that you expect the
losses in 2Q to be under $150 million?
Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Yes. David thanks for joining us. I think what you're reading and interpreting in the Q is really off base just fundamentally
off base. I think how we've always prepared our Qs is -- I mean we try to describe risk factors. We try to describe
conditions so that there is a level of clarity. You should not read anything in the Q as predicting a loss an attachment
point a session that we expect at this point in time. I think all we were pointing out though is like any property loss we do
have certain levels of reinsurance on an aggregate and per risk basis. But do not do not interpret that as a loss limit or us
trying to signal anything. That's just good disclosure.
Second on I'll call it the Navigator piece Doug. Again we're not going to get into the specifics. But all I would say again
handful of policies and there's aggregate limits in all of them. For BI we knew it's -- we knew about the program. It's a
program geared towards the entertainment industry. And once we come up with final final estimates we'll tell you when
we book them in the second quarter.
Douglas Graham Elliot
President
I would just add to that Chris. When I think about the Navigator property book it is very insignificant compared to the
size of our overall property book so less than 0.5% relative to policy count. And their book is both primary and excess. In
their primary book generally they do not have virus exclusions. But across our entire property base again I go back to
the vast majority of our policies have the virus exclusion. And we will work through those claims during the course of the
second and third quarters and come to our estimates as we close out next quarter.
Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO
Yes. The only thing that I'll add to the first part of the question and I agree with Chris' comments as it relates to things that
we commented on in our risk factors I think you may have been asking specifically about our property catastrophe treaty.
And we did specifically say that pandemic is not excluded from that treaty. And obviously given the level of losses that
would have to be in order for us to hit that we see that as very unlikely. So I think that that was the specific disclosure
that you were -- may have been referring to.
David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities Research Division
That's right. Yes that's right. Thank you for clarifying. I appreciate that and then I appreciate the response from everyone.
And I just wanted to also follow up just on -- just in putting the new money yields into cash or new money into cash. I
guess how long do you expect this to continue? And what are you specifically looking for? What do you need to see to
start deploying that back into appropriate duration bonds?
Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Yes. David thanks. I would just give you the context of what we did and why. It really is just a classic crisis playbook
right? I mean you have to admit we're in the midst of a crisis. And when we started looking at things late February early
March saw where spreads were going in the markets just game theory-ing other conditions we wanted as much liquidity
and flexibility as possible. So we decided and took the action to not reinvest principal and interest coming off the portfolio
into new credit exposures at that time because you saw the Fed didn't act until at least 2 or 3 weeks later. And it was just
a defensive cautionary position. And I think all Beth and I really wanted to do was just tell you what we did why and the
potential impacts on our run rate yield or NII from managing your expectations Beth. But that's what I would say.
Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 13
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  APR 30 2020
Yes. I think that's a good summary. I mean again I think if you go back and look over what's happened over the last
couple of months as Chris said when we looked at this beginning of March it was really more a reaction of the fact that
we saw markets and specifically credit markets were feeling stressed and we didn't want to be investing into that. As we
go through March and then we get towards the end of March into April we have more shelter-in-place orders and so forth
and some of the actions that we're taking to provide relief to our customers and the receipt of premium payments caused
us to continue to want to build liquidity.
And so our view is as we go through the second quarter and we start to see some stability in what we're seeing relative
to top line and those receipts we'd look to start then reinvesting again. But I really characterize this as moving from a --
creating a position of strength rather than any sign of weakness as it relates to our overall balance sheet.
Operator
And the next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.
Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
My first question I was hoping within your workers' comp book you can break down the exposure to health care and
other frontline workers and then maybe more on [ peripheral ] industries like supermarkets et cetera. And just give us a
sense of the areas and the exposure within your book that you think were most likely to see losses within that line from
COVID.
Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Elyse I think the only detail I'm comfortable sharing with you is for our Small Commercial and Middle Market book how
you would define health care or how we would define health care which excludes dentists and optometrists that we
would ensure our health care exposure to those on the frontline basis is less than 5% of our premium. That's the only data
point I'd like to give you at this point in time and I'm not going to break down our entire book of business for you and give
all our competitors opportunities to cherrypick it. So again very little minor frontline health care worker exposure in our
book of business.
Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question in terms of Navigators a couple of questions. Can you comment on
what accident years the development that was ceded to the ADC came from in the quarter? And then second question
related to Navigators. Can you just comment on how the margin was in Q1 relative to the 5 to 6 points of improvement
that you guys had laid out that you had expected for 2020?
Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I'm just going to wait for the team to respond.
Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO
Yes. So on the Navigators piece we really are looking at 2018 and prior. And I can't remember the exact year that was
involved but it's in that bucket. Obviously that's covered by the ADC.
Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Elyse as far as the improvement I'll look to Doug to add his color too. But I'm pleased with the trajectory the
improvements. Again we've talked about that 5 to 6 point combined ratio improvement and I'm extremely confident we
will achieve that in the time frames that we've talked about. But Doug I thought we had good progress.
Douglas Graham Elliot

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 14
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  APR 30 2020
We did. So if we look at our numbers into first quarter and compare them to a more normalized run rate which Beth and I
keep looking back at I would say the improvement is in the 3.5% range 3.5% toward 4% what we see into 2020.
I would also say to you that I'm very encouraged by our pricing progress and some of our book management programs as
well. So as we work our way through 2020 into 2021 I feel like those goals are certainly attainable and I feel like we've
made really good strides down that path Elyse.
Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
Okay. And then one last question. I know you guys know and others in the industry have mentioned right the desire
right not to have retroactive changes to policy language. We've also heard a lot of chatter about a potential perspective
plan government backstop to provide pandemic coverage on a go-forward basis. Do you have any thoughts there? And I
guess do you think that that's -- in terms of a time frame is that something -- I know there's a lot.
Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Elyse as I alluded to in my prepared comments we are working with our trade group and across the industry to develop
if we can a consensus view on options and solutions for the future. So I think it's premature to comment upon anything
right now other than the desire to contribute to a solution going forward from the industry perspective. And I think I've
talked quite a bit with my peers in the industry. And there is a desire to at least think creatively and come up with options
and potential solutions.
Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO
And then Elyse just to follow up I was able to find the accident years. It's '17 and '18 is related to those marine losses.
Operator
And the next question comes from Mike Zaremski with CrÃ©dit Suisse.
Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG Research Division
First question I know we've talked about workers' comp a lot already but maybe dig in a little bit more if you can
elaborate on your comments regarding the potential for elevated claims in that line. Maybe any broad comments on how
this recession could maybe play out differently than the last. I know there was one commercial carrier which said last
week they maybe change their reserving policies a little bit and they release less reserves to be a little more conservative
to take into account that the last recession kind of surprised them a little bit on the back end which I believe may have
also kind of happened industry-wide and to Hartford as well.
Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Let me start with a few comments to frame this. I'd start by saying that our accounts are down. But as you know we are
also working day-by-day on exposure changes with our policyholders. So until we get that exposure base where it needs
to be it's very difficult to predict frequency. But I expect over the short term we'll see improvements in claim counts. If
nothing else we understand across our manufacturing book we'll see more experienced workers. As people thin their
ranks what we'll tend to see will be more experienced workers on those lines. And as such they will get injured less
frequently.
We're watching careful medical severity. We think there will be a little bit of pressure on duration and also medical
severity. There's an awful lot of medical attention in this country right now dealing with COVID-19. And as such we're
slightly concerned that maybe all the people that need medical attention for other job-related injuries are stacking up in
the queue. So there are assortment of things relative to workers' compensation we're keeping our eye on some good and
some pressure points to watch even putting the presumption discussion to the side.
Christopher Jerome Swift

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 15
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  APR 30 2020
Mike I would just give you a larger-picture perspective in that. I mean if you're looking back to the Great Recession or
other recessions that the U.S. economy has experienced it is true that obviously unemployment and GDP is going to
shrink. A lot of those other recessions were caused by structural issues whether it be credit overextended or imbalances
in the economy.
Remember this was a shock to our U.S. economy. And the real hope and belief at least I have is with the great
advances in the medical community and some of the things that everyone's talking about and working on we can remove
the shock factor and go back to a structurally sound consumer-orientated economy that isn't stretched financially isn't
out of balance in any way shape or form. So -- but it's true. That might take some time to get the medical advancements
necessary to relieve the shock that the economy is experiencing.
Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG Research Division
Great. That's helpful. My last question is regarding more broadly commercial pricing. Do you feel that youâve been
seeing kind of pricing industry-wide continue to move north/higher given the kind of uncertainty surrounding a lot of
issues? Or are top line contractions causing more broadly kind of pricing to move downwards a bit? And I'm speaking
specifically to commercial pricing. But if you have views on also Personal Lines pricing given that seems to be a good
area to be at I'd be open to those as well.
Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Tackle commercial first. I would suggest that the early look at April April is not complete yet it will be tonight. But the early
look suggests consistency with what we saw in March. So the early part of the second quarter I think will exhibit similar
patterns to what finished quarter 1. And we'll obviously continue to watch this and manage this on a month-to-month basis
as we move into quarter 2.
Personal Lines I think there are a lot of things going on in Personal Lines including the fact that there's a fair amount
of customer premium refunding going on in Q2 and a lot happening based on miles driven but also now the potential
turn on -- turn back on of the economy. And one of the things we've debated amongst ourselves is I think we expect to
see potentially a bounce back in miles driven over the course of the summer. As people return to more normal living
conditions we expect miles driven to go up as a result maybe fewer airline miles traveled but more within their cars. So
those are all thoughts over the ensuing 3 to 4 months. But at the moment yes miles are down and we expect that to
change.
Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG Research Division
Okay. Great. We all hope you're right about the return to normalcy in the coming months.
Operator
And the next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.
Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
I had a question for Doug and then a Group Benefits question which I guess might also be for Doug. But I just recovered
the property cat stuff on reinsurance. Could you give us some indication of how some of the per-risk reinsurance on the
quota share where might that respond to any potential COVID losses?
Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Well you're right. We do have per-risk insurance inside our core property book. And obviously that would be on a risk-by-
risk basis so that will depend on severity of risk. And those plans are in place. And there are no virus exclusions attached
to those programs. So that stands as is.
There are also an assortment of other programs including Navigators has a quota share program across their property
book heavily reinsured. So you'd almost need the specific circumstance of the loss Ryan to figure out how it applies. But

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 16
THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP INC. FQ1 2020 EARNINGS CALL  APR 30 2020
number one I would say I believe we've got sound underwriting on our primary book. And number two I think we've got a
well-thought out reinsurance program that will respond if indeed it's called to.
Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
Okay. I think the other thing I wanted to hit on I guess was in Group Benefits. It seems like the short-term disability kind
of dwarfs the impact of workers' comp even though that's what everyone's been talking about. Is it safe to think that if
conditions remain like this that that $16 million for half a month would have that type of proportional impact I guess on
ensuing quarters?
Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Ryan it's Chris. I would say no. I would not do that and I'll tell you why. If you sort of break down what we booked $10
million was for paid family leave $6 million was for STD. I would say when we booked and made our estimates for the
quarter we had a claim count estimate a duration estimate. And then it's simple math from there.
The claim count that actually emerged and again New York paid family leave primarily is our risk product there is just
significantly down from what we expected. So it's not to say it can't come back. It's not to say it couldn't spike as people
look at all the benefits that are available to them. But that claim count projection was off by a factor of at least 50%.
On STD I would share with you the view that we had again has changed a little bit as we got into April in that the impact
that we booked was for increased COVID-19 STDs. And to remind you there's usually a 7-day elimination period. And
again then if someone goes on STD because of COVID-19 generally what we're seeing is a 10-day to 2-week benefit.
But there again the data that emerged in April is that yes COVID-19 claims are up but everything else is down quite
substantially. So the normal STD claims or the planned absence STD claims everyone is sort of delaying normal activities
as it would be related to STD coverages. So net-net the total claim projection or the claims and how they're emerging in
April is basically flat to slightly down with historical trends.
Now that too could reverse. But as it reverses I think we would have less COVID-19 claims going forward. So I would
not project it on a run rate basis and we'll give you transparency to what we do in the second quarter. But at least right
now there's offsetting factors that should mitigate losses.
Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
Got it. And I guess the one follow-up I had is kind of a mechanical one probably for Doug as well. But some of these
comp studies we're seeing where -- whether it's the NCCI where you're coming up with a gross workers' comp loss
estimate what are some things we should be thinking about in terms of how deductible -- in reality how that makes its
way to a loss in an insurance company right the impact that a company deductible might have to mitigate that or the
fact that it might not even make it to workers' comp right? I guess it could become a short-term disability claim or maybe
health insurance might cover it. I'm just trying to understand like trying to net that down to those gross numbers what are
some things we should be thinking about?
Douglas Graham Elliot
President
Just a few comments. It's so hard to project here. But yes the national account customer segment Fortune 2000 plus
many have some form of loss responsive program where there's either a deductible attached some kind of retention
arrangement. So yes that would not all just flow directly into comp losses.
In terms of Main Street America much of Middle Market America I think those contracts are largely guaranteed costs. So
those are risk-transfer programs. And again this is going to be a state-by-state dynamic. But I would think much of that
content change would show up in the P&L of insurers over time.
And then the last thought I have for you is that the fundamental way we run this business is that we take historical losses
and we run them through our actuarial model and then we develop rates going forward based on all the risks we're

taking. And I fully expect whether we're talking workers' comp or property as we come out of this COVID-19 experience
we'll be doing exactly that with those losses paid.
Operator
And the next question comes from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
Just Chris is it simply that it was just -- it's too early? Just curious on I guess the rationale for not putting out any kind of
expected number on the P&C side for COVID losses right now.
Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Again we reacted to what we know and what we saw. If you really think about it it was 2 weeks of the month. And
really what I'd like you to take away from it is there isn't any big surprises out there that we don't see or understand
meaning we're not in certain lines of business that people put up a lot of reserves. I mean we're not in the event
cancellation business. We don't have material trade credit exposures or anything along those lines. We don't have a
travel business. So we have our core products and our core capabilities. And yes I mean 2 weeks for -- into the virus
to sort of make any type of adjustment. And the accounting is I mean we can't book second quarter events in the first
quarter right? I mean it's got to be sort of a known and exposed first quarter events. So we'll see what develops here in
the second quarter but we're not setting out anything big in my judgment.
Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
Okay. And then I guess lastly any thoughts you could share on expectations for earnings over the rest of the year for the
Talcott business?
Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Well let's get through the crisis and the immediate events here. I mean we're not going to re-project or give new
guidance at this point in time. So...
Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO
I'm sorry. Which were you asking for?
Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Guidance for the rest of the year.
Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO
For Talcott he said.
Christopher Jerome Swift
Chairman & CEO
Oh excuse me.
Beth A. Costello
Executive VP & CFO
So yes so that's hard to predict obviously. As we said we record Talcott earnings on a quarter lag. So we typically get
their financial statements 45 50 days after quarter end. I'd expect that given their -- the hedging profile of that entity that

we're likely to see gains from the first quarter. And I'd point you to look at first quarter of 2019 when they recorded the
impact of the fourth quarter of 2018 and the impact of hedging gains that we saw there.
And then as far as predicting dividends I mean that gets difficult to do. We were pleased to get a dividend last year. And
we know that their plan is to continue to pay dividends. But until we get the cash in the door we don't count it. It's not
included in any of our holding company projections of cash flows.
