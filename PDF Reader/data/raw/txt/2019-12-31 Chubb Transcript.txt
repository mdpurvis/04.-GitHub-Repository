Presentation
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Chubb Limited Fourth Quarter Year-end 2019 Earnings Conference Call.
Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]
For opening remarks and introductions I would like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer Senior Vice
President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Karen L. Beyer
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to Chubb's December 31 2019 Fourth Quarter
Year-end Earnings Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements including
statements relating to company performance and growth opportunities pricing and business mix and
economic and market conditions which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may
differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings earnings release and financial supplement which are
available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these
matters.
We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures reconciliations of which to the most direct
comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial
supplement.
Now it's my pleasure to introduce our speakers this morning. First we have Evan Greenberg Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft our Chief Financial Officer. We'll then take your
questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And
now I will turn the call over to Evan.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Good morning. As you saw from the numbers we reported core operating income in the fourth quarter of
$2.28 per share up 13% from prior year. The quarter was marked by excellent premium revenue growth
globally driven by an improved and improving pricing and underwriting environment that is spreading
to more lines of business and more territories. Our organic growth in the commercial lines underwriting
environment were the best in over 5 years. We also experienced a fairly active quarter globally for
weather-related and man-made catastrophes including the impact of weather on our U.S. agriculture
business.
Core operating income was just over $1 billion. Our published P&C combined ratio for the quarter was
92.7% about 0.5 point improvement over prior year with P&C underwriting income up 12%. On the one
hand we benefited from lower year-over-year catastrophe losses. You may have noticed that half of our
total cat losses in the quarter was from one event a tornado that destroyed 1 mile by 1.5 miles affluent
neighborhood in the suburbs of Dallas where Chubb had significant market share. What are the odds? But
that's our business.
On the other hand as you saw from our preannouncement we reported an underwriting loss of $23
million for the quarter in our crop insurance business attributable to yield shortfalls from difficult growing
conditions compared with an underwriting gain of $161 million in last year's fourth quarter. As I've pointed
out before by its nature crop insurance is a business with cat-like exposures. After all it's about moisture
and temperature i.e. the weather. The risk/reward for crop insurance has been favorable for Chubb over
the long short and medium term. And after 3 exceptional years in '16 to '18 last year was below average.
For the quarter the Global P&C combined ratio which excludes agriculture was 91.9% compared with
95.2% prior year. And on a current accident year basis excluding cat it was an outstanding 88.6% versus
89.9% last year.

CHUBB LIMITED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020
To briefly recap the year core operating earnings of $4.6 billion were up over 5% with P&C underwriting
income up 4.5%. Global P&C underwriting income which again excludes ag was up 18.5%. The Global
P&C combined ratios both calendar and current accident year were simply excellent. The calendar year
was down from the year before and the current accident year excluding cats was flat with prior year.
Book and tangible book value per share were up 11.7% and 18.6% respectively for the year driven by
a combination of income and the mark from falling interest rates. Phil will have more to say about the
investment income book value cats and prior period development.
Turning to growth and the rate environment. P&C premium revenue in the quarter in constant dollars was
excellent and as I noted a moment ago the strongest organic premium revenue growth in over 5 years.
Net premiums grew 9.8% before foreign exchange which had less than 1 point of negative impact. The
pricing environment continued to improve quarter-on-quarter with the rate of increase accelerating and
spreading to more classes of business and risk types.
Overall price has increased in North America commercial which includes both major accounts and
specialty as well as middle market and small commercial by 8.3% on a written basis versus a current loss
cost trend of about 4.5%. Renewal price change includes both rate of 9% and a slight decline in exposure
of about 0.5%.
We continue to benefit from a flight to quality. More business continues to meet our underwriting
standards and new and existing customers choose Chubb. New business was up nearly 10% in the
quarter and renewal retention was excellent 95.5% on a premium and 87% on a policy count basis.
In major accounts and specialty commercial excluding ag premiums grew over 10.5% with major
accounts retail growth of 9% and E&S wholesale growth of 10%. In terms of rate increases rates for
major accounts were up 10.5% with risk management up 5.5% excess casualty up 27% and property
and short-tail lines up 20%. Management liability rates increased 20%.
In our Westchester E&S wholesale business rates were up 15%; property up over 19%; casualty up
15%; and financial lines up nearly 12% all well above third quarter's increases. Rates in our Chubb
Bermuda business were up 33%.
Turning to our U.S. middle market and small commercial division. Premiums grew over 7.5% and
excluding workers' comp we grew 10%. The renewal retention in our middle market business was nearly
94%. Middle market pricing was up 5% and excluding comp it was up nearly 7%. Pricing for casualty
ex comp was up about 6% while comp pricing was down about 4.5%. Package was up 6% property up
10.5% and Financial Lines rates were up almost 8%.
In our North America Personal Lines business net premiums in the quarter were up over 9%. But adjusted
for additional reinsurance items which negatively impacted prior year growth we grew 4.5%. Retention
remains strong at 97.5% on a premium basis and over 89% on a policy basis. Homeowners' pricing was
up nearly 13% in the quarter. We are making great progress in reshaping the portfolio to more closely
focus on clients who meet our risk profile.
Turning to our international business. Growth remains strong in our overseas general insurance operations
with premiums written up 9% in constant dollars and FX then had a negative impact about 2.5
percentage points. Net premiums for our London market wholesale business were up 22% while our retail
division was up almost 8% with growth broadly distributed across the globe. Growth in our international
retail was led by Continental Europe up nearly 10.5% and the best growth in many years followed by
Latin America and Asia Pac up over 9% and 8% respectively and the U.K. up over 5.5%. Overall rates in
our international retail business were up 10%; property up 11%; casualty up 3%; and Financial Lines up
17%. Rates in our London wholesale business were up 20%; property up 21%; Financial Lines up 16%;
and aviation up 27%.
Our Asia-focused international life insurance business had a strong quarter with net premiums up over
14% in constant dollar and a contribution to earnings of $36 million up over 12% from prior year. John
Keogh John Lupica Paul Krump and Juan Luis Ortega can provide further color on the quarter including
current market conditions and pricing trends.

CHUBB LIMITED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020
In closing it was a good quarter and year for Chubb. Premium revenue growth continued to accelerate
as more business meets our underwriting standards and we achieve greater price adequacy in a rapidly
improving underwriting environment. We have started the new year in excellent shape with a lot of
momentum. Our organization was built on a global scale to capitalize on market conditions such as this.
We have patiently waited and remain disciplined and true to our culture and the craft of underwriting
excellence. We are now capitalizing on greater opportunity. At the same time we are not taking our eye
off the execution of our many important long-term strategic initiatives that position us for future revenue
and earnings growth including our increasing ownership stake in Huatai Insurance Group progress we are
making with our digital efforts a growing international consumer lines operation and our growth strategies
for middle market and small commercial around the globe.
With that I'll turn the call over to Phil and then we'll be back to take your questions.
Philip V. Bancroft
EVP & CFO
Thanks Evan. We completed the year with a very strong overall financial position. Businesses and
investment performance produced positive cash flow of $1.4 billion for the quarter and $6.3 billion for the
year. Our total capital grew to over $70 billion and our cash and invested assets grew $8.6 billion for the
year to $111 billion. In addition as Evan mentioned our book and tangible book value per share were
11.7% and 18.6% respectively. For the year excluding unrealized gains from declining interest rates
book and tangible book value per share grew 5.5% and 8.1% respectively.
Among the capital-related actions in the quarter we returned $650 million to shareholders including
$340 million in dividends and $310 million in share repurchases. For the year we returned $2.9 billion to
shareholders including $1.4 billion in dividends and over $1.5 billion in share repurchases at an average
price of $146.61 per share.
In December we issued $1.6 billion of 5-year and 10-year debt in European markets at an average
interest rate of 0.59%. For the year we have issued 2.8 billion of euro debt and paid off $500 million of
debt that matured. This debt will be used to fund certain future debt maturities and other corporate uses.
Our annualized core operating ROE for the year was 9% and our core operating return on tangible equity
was 14.6%. As previously announced in December we increased our ownership stake in Huatai Insurance
Group to 30.9% and agreed to purchase another 22.4% in 2 separate transactions contingent on certain
approvals and other conditions. We will hold a majority stake when we complete the second transaction.
Until then we continue to apply equity accounting to our Huatai ownership.
Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $893 million pretax and $3.6 billion pretax for the
year. The investment income in the quarter was slightly below our previous guidance due to lower-than-
expected private equity distributions. While there are a number of factors that impact the variability in
investment income we now expect our quarterly run rate to be in the range of $885 million to $895
million. After-tax net realized and unrealized gains were $268 million for the quarter and $3 billion for the
year primarily from a decline in interest rates in the fixed income portfolio.
Net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $430 million pretax or $350 million after-tax as previously
announced and are further detailed in the financial supplement. We had favorable prior period
development in the quarter of $233 million pretax or $199 million after-tax. This is net of $74 million
adverse development from our legacy runoff exposure principally related to asbestos. The remaining
favorable development of $307 million is split approximately 67% in long-tail lines principally from
accident years 2015 and prior and 33% in short-tail lines.
The full year agriculture combined ratio was 95.1% compared with 75.5% in the prior year or a decline of
$296 million in underwriting income from higher crop losses. Given this year's results we do not expect
the 2019 crop year to develop anywhere near as favorably in 2020 as the 2018 year developed in the
first quarter of 2019. As a reminder we had positive development of over $60 million in last year's first
quarter.

CHUBB LIMITED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020
On a constant dollar basis net loss reserves decreased $118 million in the quarter reflecting the impact
of catastrophe loss payments favorable prior period development and crop insurance payments in the
quarter. On a reported basis the paid-to-incurred ratio was 106%. After adjusting for the items noted
above the paid-to-incurred ratio was 98%. For the year net loss reserves increased $514 million on a
constant dollar basis. On a reported basis the paid-to-incurred ratio for the year was 99% and was 92%
adjusted for the items noted above.
Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.2% which is in line with our annual expected
range although it's at the lower end of the range given the impact of catastrophe losses in the quarter.
For the year our core operating effective tax rate was 14.9%. For 2020 we expect our annual core
operating effective tax rate to continue to be in the range of 14% to 16%.
I'll turn the call back to -- I mean Karen I'm sorry.
Karen L. Beyer
Senior Vice President of Investor Relations
Thank you. And at this point we'll be happy to take your questions.

Question and Answer
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We will begin with Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley.
Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
I guess first question Evan a very high-level question and I kind of apologize in advance it's kind of a
generic question but I really want to get your thoughts on this. Look the industry is reacting to I guess
sins of the past if you will from pricing and the reactionary nature of the industry. You seemly don't
have to do that as much because your prior year stuff was already strong. And so the question here is
kind of more of how do you think about -- the answer is really your account-by-account detail of your
underwriting at which you guys do phenomenally well. But at a high level Evan how do you steer the
ship with thinking about just the trade-off between -- you have a cushion that you could maybe not really
worry about margin expansion as much because you've got such great envious margins and think about
the growth that you could possibly get even higher growth if you gave up a little bit more on the margin
expansion. So just kind of a high level how you think about that tug-of-war between the pricing that you
want to get the growth you want to get versus the margins that you get on that.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes. I don't think about it that way and not how an underwriting organization really thinks about it. Your
question is in a sense too simplistic. We quote the rates and prices and underwriting terms that we
require in each line of business to earn what we think is an adequate risk-adjusted return as expressed
by a combined ratio in that line of business. It then all mixes together in portfolio which you then see as
an overall published average combined ratio. And so you can't -- in the Commercial P&C business which
runs higher than the average that you look at at the whole company you then dig down by line and
there are lines of business that are -- that we think are adequate now or maybe a bit above adequate in
some cases and there are lines of business that are below adequate and we'll continue to drive for rate.
Wherever we see adequacy and we like the risk-reward we're hardly holding back on growth. And I think
the question is a little ironic this quarter when you're asking it in the backdrop of fundamentally a 10%
growth rate on an organization of this size. I hope that helps you.
Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
Okay. Yes. And a little more detail then on the follow-up.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
I think you had a second question.
Michael Wayne Phillips
Morgan Stanley Research Division
I did. Yes. This is more detailed. On Overseas General a kind of nitpicky question here on your expense
ratio how to think about that in 2020. I mean it looks like it's ticked up a bit throughout '19 more on the
acquisition expense. And what's behind anything deliberate there and how to think of that through 2020.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes. It's pretty simple. About 1/3 of it is -- of the increase is related to onetime items last year that
benefited last year's expense ratio. About 1/3 of it is mix of business where it's business that runs a lower
loss ratio a higher expense ratio and some of the partnerships we have will have that signature to them

CHUBB LIMITED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020
because the mix of product is a lower loss ratio related. And the third is investments we've been making in
certain businesses particularly in Asia and to a degree in Latin America to grow -- for future growth. And
we'll grow into our sleeves there and the expense ratio will ameliorate and improve.
Operator
We'll now hear from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler.
Jon Paul Newsome
Piper Sandler & Co. Research Division
Congratulations on the quarter and year.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Thanks.
Jon Paul Newsome
Piper Sandler & Co. Research Division
I want to ask about North American casualty the loss trend that you mentioned because that seems to be
a big topic of just how -- that you may be accelerating. Could you maybe talk about maybe what's going
on there as well as -- I would imagine and tell me if I'm wrong there are pieces in there with some pretty
high loss trends maybe D&O professional liability? And then where are the offsets?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes. No. Yes without going into too much detail just to give the shape of it a little bit first of all I
don't agree with your last comment. I think it's -- I don't -- it's not how we see it. D&O is an old story.
We've been talking about it for a while. Frequency and severity both moved up but that was a couple
of years ago and we've seen it pretty steady at that elevated level. We don't see that continuing to
deteriorate overall and that's all classes that we've mixed together in there. There are some classes
individual classes subclasses that have an increasing frequency but overall. In primary casualty we're
seeing severity stable. We haven't -- in the risk transfer primary casualty area we haven't noticed a
deterioration. In workers' comp in the risk transfer comp business through the year we've seen an
increase of severity particularly on the '18 and '19 years. And by the way so all of our loss cost trends
we're comfortable with our picks. And we're constantly looking at updated data and the trends we see are
reflected in our loss cost picks for the year for the back years and inform us as we go forward into the '20
year. I hope that helps you.
Jon Paul Newsome
Piper Sandler & Co. Research Division
No. No. It makes a ton of sense. And then secondly I just wanted to make sure -- I think I have a good
guess at this but the Asian exposure to all this virus just the economic turmoil that's resulting there I
would imagine and tell me if I'm wrong that you've got fairly minimal exposures from losses but there
might be some sales disruption just because people won't be able to get out. Is that a kind of a good way
to think about it? Or is there something else I should be thinking about? I don't expect it's kind of a big
deal...
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
We're experienced -- we're informed in our underwriting from past pandemics and/or potential pandemics.
SARS was a good run at this. And given our underwriting position and how we think about supply chains
and how we think about property in the perils we cover et cetera we see very minimal loss exposure from
this. We have a very small almost nonexistent accident and health business in China. And we don't see
-- we imagine modest impact from everything we can tell from economic slowdown or economic activity.

CHUBB LIMITED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020
But time will tell in that regard. We don't know the true infection rate likely and we don't know when this
is going to peak. And so that's what I can give you based on what we know today.
Jon Paul Newsome
Piper Sandler & Co. Research Division
Obviously keep your fingers crossed there.
Operator
Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo has the next question.
Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
My first question Evan in your prepared remarks you talked about strongest growth you guys have seen
in 5 years. You also painted a picture of a lot of price going to your book that you said continued into
2020. So as we think about 2020 do you see price and growth picking up as we move throughout the
year. And I guess how long -- do you have a line of sight in terms of how long do you think the upward
pricing momentum might last?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes. You're asking me a bunch of questions that you know I'm not going to answer much Elyse but I
admire you for asking. Look I can't -- I'm not going to prognosticate the balance of the year. I'm going to
-- the only thing I would tell you is I think growth we ran about 7% in '19 and I think that's -- we'll be
in the range if not better in the '20 underwriting year is my sense of it but no guarantees. And there's
always a little volatility quarter-to-quarter given some seasonality and mix of business. So you never see
it in just some steady steady way.
On pricing I think it endures. The fundamentals speak to it. And so the environment we see is the
environment I imagine will continue for some time. It's rational. And there are many reasons for it and
there's nothing that I see that tells me the momentum will slow. If anything it's picked up and it is
spreading more broadly. Industry needs rate and needs it in quite a number of classes and across the
globe. And then you're in a low interest rate environment and you can hardly rely on investment income to
bail you out and the industry needs rate because rate has just not kept pace with loss cost trend for quite
a number of years. The math is so simple. People seem to overintellectualize this.
And then on the other side of the coin in the numerator there are a few discrete classes where the
loss environment is more hostile and that is out there. That is understood. That is known and you
either recognized it and reflected it in your reserves and in your loss picks and pricing in the past or
it's something that you're dealing with currently and is in front of you but I think that just varies by
organization.
Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
Okay. That's helpful. And then secondly we've heard a lot in the reinsurance market about prices going up
at January 1 and I think there are some expectations we'll see that continuing throughout the year. Does
Chubb have any thoughts of changing their reinsurance program in a significant degree for what you had
placed in 2019 your outbound program?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
I'm not -- that is a treaty-by-treaty book-of-business by book-of-business decision. We make rational
decisions around all of that. And so I'm not going to make any general statements about that.

CHUBB LIMITED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020
Okay. And then one last question. In the past you guys have given us your excess capital in terms of the
drag on your ROE. Could you let us know about where that will fit after you make the next investment
within the Huatai? Have you increased your stake over the next couple of deals?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Go ahead Phil.
Philip V. Bancroft
EVP & CFO
I'd say 5% to 7% drag on the ROE.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
I'm sorry?
Philip V. Bancroft
EVP & CFO
5% to 7%.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
No it's not a 5%. It's a 0.5%.
Philip V. Bancroft
EVP & CFO
I'm sorry. 50 to 70 basis points.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes.
Philip V. Bancroft
EVP & CFO
5 to 7.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Elyse he -- what we said is 50 to 75 basis points of drag on ROE.
Elyse Beth Greenspan
Wells Fargo Securities LLC Research Division
Ok. Great. I appreciate the color.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
You're welcome.
Operator
And our next question will come from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.

spglobal.com/marketintelligence 11
CHUBB LIMITED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020
Evan I think in a response to a previous question you had said that you'd seen the D&O option started
to deteriorate at least 2 years ago or about 2 years ago. Just curious what happened 6 months ago 4
months ago when rates started to really move up? Why was there like a 1.5 years lag there?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Sure. And by the way we saw it 2 or 3 years ago. It's 3 years we've been talking about it because it
was the '17 year '17 '18 '19 so sorry even longer. Look you get notices. Notices turn into -- you get
notices of circumstance. You get -- you then get notices of claim. You get those turning into incurs. And
then ultimately they move to cash flow. And those who have large books of this see and play -- both the
primary and the excess they see it and they play. First player excess they see it earlier and have a sense
of it have the data have the experience to know which cases are going to turn into which -- what kind of
loss and what is a realistic loss amount around that case. They have the data and understanding to see
a law firm behavior -- and by the way the nature of the type of claims that are changing in how they're
being made. And so you get a sense of all of that early if you're in the position and which we are and
we're a market leader that way and we see it on a global basis. We could look at it early. There are others
who just -- they arrive at it late and they arrive at it when it turns into incurred and paid losses. And you
get an education but you pay a tuition for it.
Yaron Joseph Kinar
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Research Division
Got it. That's helpful. And then my second question not really related North America Personal. I think
the delta between adjusted net premiums written and growth in -- and net premiums growth had been
positive for the last 4 quarters and then this quarter turned negative. Just trying to understand the
dynamic there. I know that you guys have added a quota share insurance -- reinsurance policy for
California but just trying to understand what happened in the quarter.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yaron I think you're -- I'm sorry maybe we're looking at different numbers or you're confused. We grew
first of all on a published basis at 9%. When you adjust for the California reinsurance which we placed
last year and it had a bigger impact last year than this year because we made a premium transfer to them
of unearned premium if you understand how that works. And therefore the adjusted real growth rate
is 4.5%. 4.5% if you look back on previous quarters is our best growth in premium terms in the year.
And it has a combination of rate and a reasonable level of retention as we also shape the portfolio and
there are areas where we're eliminating exposure. And by the way we got 13 points of price change in the
quarter.
Operator
Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse has the next question.
Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG Research Division
First question maybe sticking on Personal Lines. Yes the pricing in Personal Lines seems to have
accelerated and I know you've talked about reshaping the portfolio. And I also believe in past quarters
you've been cited as saying loss costs in Personal Lines is as high as the high single digits. Maybe you can
kind of talk about why loss cost inflation is at that level and some other of your competitors don't speak to
it being that high. And maybe you can talk more broadly about the reshaping and then what -- where you
are in that reshaping.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes. Sure. First of all I don't know who you're thinking of as a competitor but we don't write general
market homeowners. We write only affluent. And the share of market we have in there is -- and our

reach our national reach on that business is just [ fivefold ]. The loss costs in the homeowners business
are running in that 8% range. They have been for some time. Cost of materials cost of labor there is
a labor shortage. And materials particularly at the high end are very expensive. Business interruption
homeowners out of their homes interrupted an extra living expense is up because there is more
remediation work in a claim than there was in the past more around mold and other conditions that
people are more concerned about and that are focused on and get attention. And then frequency of loss
has contributed particularly in nonweather water-related which we've talked about for some time and
others have the same issues. So when you add all that up those are the main contributing factors to loss
cost trend. I don't see it ameliorating by the way not much.
Michael David Zaremski
Crédit Suisse AG Research Division
Okay. That's very helpful. And lastly thanks for the color on loss expense trend. I'm curious when you
talked about the trend in North America does that take into account some of the state changes in terms
of the statutes of limitations some reviver statutes? So maybe you could comment on that.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes. It takes into account everything we know in our portfolio. So I'm not leaving anything out. However
-- so on the reviver statute changes there's notices. There's notice activity and filing of claims but there's
very little information at this moment to respond to. And that's going to be in my judgment quite a while
developing. And I don't -- there's not much to respond to at this point. Just take New York for example. All
of the cases are being consolidated with one court and judge who's going to just figure out how to move
forward with these in a structured way. So the rules and the process by which these will be adjudicated is
yet to be determined. So you can't take discovery. You can't get information. You can't do anything right
now and that's the plaintiff and the defendant let alone then the insurer that is a derivative of all of this.
So it's going to evolve over a period of time. But right now anything we know where it's -- where it can
be estimated is in our numbers.
Operator
And we'll now take a question from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.
Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
Evan just in North America Commercial I was hoping you could give us some color on how you'd
characterize the accident year loss ratio improvement 64% versus 66% a year ago 1.5 points of
improvement sequentially. How -- is that mostly the earned premium and excessive trend? Was it benign
attritional activity? I'm just trying to think about what's going on from a margin standpoint there.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
How would I characterize it? I'd characterize it as darn good. There you go Ryan. Look last year we did
take some reserve charge you will recall so think about it for a short-tail that did not repeat. And we
recognized a higher loss pick for that and the improvement is a combination of earned rate underwriting
which frankly is more powerful than the earned rate and actions we take in that regard. And that's about
it because we had seen a lot of change in loss environment.
Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
Got it. And then I had one for Phil and then one more for Evan. But Phil on the Huatai consolidation how
should we think about the impact that that might have on either -- on book value per share tangible
book value per share if you do go over that 50% threshold?

EVP & CFO
Yes. It's way too early for that. We're evaluating it. We'll continue to evaluate it but I'm not ready to give
you an impact on tangible at this point.
Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
Understood. And then I guess keeping on these legacy issues Evan. For Chubb and I guess the industry
in general how are you thinking about with the opioid litigation going on how that might manifest as an
insurance liability?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes. And I don't think of that as legacy. I think of that as current. It's like other mass tort that exists. So I
don't see legacy in that. It's -- when it comes to opioid you got to make it -- we don't cover -- insurance
doesn't cover financial loss. We cover a loss due to bodily injury property damage. And you have to have
that clear linkage in liabilities. You got to prove liability and you got to prove in liability that it resulted
in bodily injury and property damage and/or property damage. And the cases that are brought against
pharma right now are brought for financial loss because the municipalities and society had a big financial
penalty as a result of the overuse of opioids. That's what's alleged then making the case to insurance.
Well you've got -- there's plenty of -- you got to leap the hurdle I just said in that regard. You got to
be able to demonstrate that you know -- that you weren't aware when you bought insurance that these
things were going on and other defenses. And so right now as far as coverage and what exists we look at
our portfolio through that lens and through those eyes. And then if we see an estimated liability we reflect
it in our records in our books and records and in our therefore reserves period.
Ryan James Tunis
Autonomous Research LLP
I guess my one follow-up there would be is this something that the insureds understand the difference
between BI and financial? Or is this the type of -- in other words is this something you're able to sort out
with your clients? Or is this something that ultimately is going to have to be resolved insurance-related
disputes policy wording like that sort of thing?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
You know what Ryan welcome to the insurance business. It varies by insured and a both intellectually
and their own character of do they -- do you understand the spirit of intent and then versus let's go
torture the language and see what we can get. And so it's all over the lot always all over.
Operator
We'll now hear from Meyer Shields with KBW.
Meyer Shields
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. Research Division
Evan in your opening comments you noted that there was a small headwind to premium growth from
exposure as opposed to last quarter's small increase. I was wondering whether there's anything significant
in that change.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
No. And what I gave you Meyer was simply -- which is kind of an oversimplistic way of doing it what I
said to you was that pricing was up 8.5% in North America all the businesses rolled up and that it was
made up of 9% in rate and 0.5% in exposure that -- negative exposure. That exposure change is just --

CHUBB LIMITED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020
we have businesses with positive exposure change and more in the middle market and small commercial
and then it jumps all over the lot in the large account business. And so I wouldn't -- there's -- it's got puts
and calls in it. There's no general theme to read into that whatsoever.
Meyer Shields
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. Research Division
Okay. Fantastic. And then in the 2 North America nonagriculture segments there was a bigger year-over-
year increase in admin expenses than we've seen year-to-date through September. And I was hoping you
could add some color to what's driving that.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
In which one are you looking at North America?
Meyer Shields
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. Research Division
Commercial and personal right the admin expenses.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
I'm sorry?
Meyer Shields
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. Research Division
The administrative expenses.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Did you say North America though?
Meyer Shields
Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc. Research Division
Oh I'm sorry. Yes North America Commercial and North America Personal.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
North America Personal. There was nothing -- go ahead Phil.
Philip V. Bancroft
EVP & CFO
There were a couple of items in the prior year related to pension and other benefits that benefited this last
year and so it makes it look like an increase this year.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Pension adjustment expense. It can bounce around a little bit year by year. You don't know. It will depend
on interest rate levels and all that at the end of this year of how it will look versus the year before.

Our next question will come from Brian Meredith with UBS.

CHUBB LIMITED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020
Two here for you. Evan just a quick follow-up on Meyer's question about the exposure. I'm just curious
are you guys picking up market share right now? And kind of what is the unit kind of growth in North
America Commercial as well as in overseas? Or is this not the time for you guys to pick up market share?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Oh I think we're picking up market share. But as far as unit I think the numbers kind of demonstrate
that. But unit growth we don't have a unit growth number for you in terms of policy yes.
Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
Okay. But -- I got you but I guess...
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Yes. No we're picking up market share.
Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
You're picking up market share. So I guess to go back to the question I guess Meyer was asking the
8.5% pricing in North America right you said a little bit of exposure. I would have thought that would be
even higher.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
You're missing it. No you're missing how to define exposure. We are growing -- that's not how insurance
companies when they say exposure growth give it to you. So we're growing exposure by writing more
clients. That 0.5% that goes into pricing happens to do with how -- clients have a rate against exposure
to determine their premium. That's their own payroll. That's their own receipts et cetera. And they then
report that to you and that goes into their actual premium price. See what I mean?
Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
Right. Yes yes absolutely I got that.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
That's very different than is Chubb and its written premium growing exposure. Oh we're growing
exposure.
Brian Robert Meredith
UBS Investment Bank Research Division
Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question just curious on your global A&H business growth has
been fairly muted for a little while. Is that just a function of just economic activity globally? Or is there
something else to read into that?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
No. Latin America is growing quite well. Europe grows at an unexciting sort of steady rate low single digit.
It's Asia Pac where the underlying activity is very good and it's growing well. But we lost a client Siam
Commercial Bank earlier in the year and we talked about that and that has impacted that growth rate
year-on-year. And what I -- you'll see as the year goes along that A&H growth will pick up.

[Operator Instructions] We'll now hear from David Motemaden from Evercore.
David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities Research Division
Just a quick numbers one for Evan and maybe Phil. Just on the civil unrest losses that we saw the $33
million. Is any of that spilling over into 1Q especially in Chile just given the protests that are still going on
there?
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
No not that we see. De minimis.
David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities Research Division
Okay. Great. And then just -- I saw in the December slides Evan you had laid out around 45% of the
-- of your business is exposed to a hardening rate environment. Just wondering what that percentage is
today just given that it's spreading to other lines and other geographies.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
That's up. It's up -- it's not up dramatically. We haven't updated the number yet.
David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities Research Division
Okay. Great. And then with the Huatai investment or the increased stake just wondering why you guys
chose to increase your share there as opposed to maybe applying to get a fully owned license there like
some of your peers have.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Well we do. We have a fully owned and Chubb insurance is a wholly owned completely 100% foreign-
invested. And if you want to go on that direction that's the 100-year plan or more. We have with
Huatai 600 offices around the country. We have most all provinces. It's a life insurance company that --
and foreigners have just been allowed to now own majority in life insurance but it has a life insurance
company that we built and helped to build that is doing -- closing on $1 billion of revenue. It's got a P&C
company doing about $1.5 billion or so. Got a retail mutual fund license. Good luck getting one of those.
It's got so much capability that it gives us to build from. And if you go simply as a foreigner entering China
de novo to build it is very hostile both the regulatory and the business environment and very difficult
to get it done. You have to do it province by province. You got to go city by city and not simply you get
it at a national level. It's not how it works in China. So this is a very precious asset if we execute well in
recognizing the future value of that asset.
David Kenneth Motemaden
Evercore ISI Institutional Equities Research Division
Yes. Understood. And I guess just thinking about in terms of the number of Board seats there I guess
how much control do you have over Huatai? I mean obviously that will increase as you buy up your stake.
And just some of those benefits that you had mentioned in terms of having the local expertise which Pru
UK has mentioned as well with their relationship with CITIC. Do you see any risk once you guys go up to
wholly ownership or maybe even up to like 100% that that becomes a headwind?

CHUBB LIMITED FQ4 2019 EARNINGS CALL  FEB 05 2020
No. I don't. And I've been doing business there for almost 30 years. So I know something about the
environment there and approach it with my eyes open and from a perspective that I'm going to -- that's
the perspective with which I'm going to give you the next comment. When we have majority we have
very clear control. Right now we have substantial influence and control to do more things in there. But
obviously with majority is when you have clear control. That will happen relatively near term. Secondly
China is like doing business anywhere. If you're a builder of business versus an investor then you
understand it not in some sterile way and that is that every territory every country China in particular
are complicated and they have risk around them. There's no guarantees. But the opportunity if you
execute well -- and the opportunity in China is simply dramatic. It's a country of a lot of talented people.
Our ability to source talent ability to recognize leadership our ability to use talent that we have around
the region and around the world including Chinese we have those tools and those advantages. And we've
got -- it's a country of relationships and we have a lot of them.
And so it is again not without risk. But given the reward and the potential and that it is the largest and
what will be the largest economy in the world and it's the second largest now well I'll tell you what it's
not a hard decision to make the long-term potential value creation for this organization. And that's what
it's about: long-term value creation.
Operator
Looks like we have time for one more question and that question will come from Greg Peters with
Raymond James.
Charles Gregory Peters
Raymond James & Associates Inc. Research Division
Evan I just had one question. I guess it sort of dovetails with this long-term value creation comment
you just made. If I look in your earnings press releases you always include both core operating return
on equity results and then you include a core operating return on equity on tangible equity results. So
I'm not trying to be argumentative. But could you remind me of the thought process behind the tangible
reference? I assume the goodwill from Chubb and other acquisitions continues to be valuable. So I'm just
looking for clarification there.
Evan G. Greenberg
Chairman & CEO
Sure it is. I am -- first of all I think tangible is your most constraining factor when you're -- when you
-- in a balance sheet risk business you can only pay claims against tangible can only grow your revenue
and exposure to the extent of your tangible wherewithal. You can only borrow and you can only make
acquisition to the extent of tangible. It's your most constraining factor. Tangible is also the purest. Book --
straight book has accounting what I'd say is more accounting-related within it it's more subjective than
objective. When I look at return on equity versus tangible return on equity tangible is the one I have my
eye on more for value creation. When I look at equity and return on equity -- the Chubb I look at it over
a long term and you said it right to me depends on -- it varies by company and you have to be able to
assess that.
The goodwill I think is an appreciating asset in this company not a -- hardly a depreciating or stagnant.
It opened the path to such future value creation of the organization that is occurring over time and will
occur over time. And the goodwill you grow into that goodwill. And because it's an appreciating asset
the Chubb and ACE combination that created most of that created that value that way. So that's how we
see it and I think it's the right balance in how we think about value creation. So thanks for the question. I
didn't take it as argumentative.
Operator
That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back to your host for closing remarks.
